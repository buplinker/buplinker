MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTQ5MzMzMzM=,4,"Zig stacking: slow down floor-filling, scale sets instead","[regret-index says:]
Filling zig floors entirely pretty quickly over additional zigs does
establish a very high tier of difficulty for ziggurats, but it also
thoroughly centralizes approaches and character builds towards mass
conjurations after the first few.  With the excess in-place being extra
visible with ziggurat figurines, easily reaching the hard monster cap
easily at seven to ten ziggurats, it seems appropiate to revise the
ziggurat stacking difficulty curve.
On a set-by-set basis, through tiered linear weighting, all ziggurat
monster sets now scale with ziggurat completion, spawning much less of
the weaker flavour spawns and much more of the high level spawns. Said
scaling mostly reach asymptotic points that differ based on the vague
preservation of first-zig set balance and the inherent available threate
of that set's theming, for the most part slowing at early to late twenty
zigs. This is paired with a new hd pool formula that moves at roughly a
third of the original speed (but which fixes a long-standing slight
reduction to the first zig's hd pool).  Multiple-ziggurat balance being
as arbitrary and isolated as it is, this more elegant scaling provides a
stronger but delayed top-end of ziggurat floors, allowing
non-conjurations builds to play more ziggurats more and giving
conjurations users some even nastier floors.
Of course, there's also some house-keeping with each set's contents to
support this idea of zig stacking set scaling, promoting and adding a
few monsters to minor explicit weighting status or more standard
appearance rates for use in the set-upscaling or just general support
variety. The starter few ziggurats shouldn't be that much more
difficult, proportionally, for whatever that implies about brief dips
into them for items and experience.

Lair: Extra hydras and torpor snails; eventual high emphasis on
catoblepae, hellephants, spriggan druids, and caustic shrikes.
Snake: Eventual high emphasis on greater nagas and quicksilver
dragons.
Swamp: Eventual high emphasis on tentacled monstrosities and
shambling mangroves.
Shoals: Eventual high emphasis of merfolk aquamancers and water
nymphs.
Spider: Extra emperor scorpions, torpor snails, entropy weavers, and
moths of wrath: high eventual focus on the aforementioned, orb
spiders, and ghost moths.
Slime: Gets, emphasizes giant eyeballs, (extra) azure jellies and
acid blobs.
Orc: A sprinkling of juggernauts after the first zig, with eventual
high emphasis on orc warlords, orc high priests, and juggernauts.
Elf: Eventual high emphasis on deep elf high priests, deep elf
blademasters, and deep elf master archers.
Vaults: Extra glowing shapeshifters and sphinxes: eventual emphasis
on titans, ancient liches, and golden dragons.
Crypt: Gets extra ancient champions; eventual emphasis on them, curse
skulls, profane esrvitors, revenants, bone dragons, and ancient
liches.
Tomb: Eventual emphasis on greater mummies.

liches; eventual emphasis on them and corrupters.

Gehenna: Extra hellions and hell knights; eventual emphasis on them,
balrugs, and brimstone fiends.
Iron City of Dis: Extra iron dragons and iron giants; eventual
emphasis on them, war gargoyles, and hell sentinels.
Tartarus: Extra silent spectres, shadow demons, and reapers; eventual
emphasis on the latter two, curse toes, and shadow fiends.
Fire: Eventual emphasis on fire dragons, fire giants, salamander
stormcallers, and (especially) orbs of fire.
Ice: Eventual emphasis on white draconian knights, shard shrikes, and
ice fiends.
Air: Gets spark wasps (mid-tiered); eventual focus on storm dragons,
titans, and electric golems.
Earth: Loses juggernauts and corrosion; the connections are tenuous
and the theme of omni-resistant conjurations-slingers is fine enough,
especially with the eventual scaling on hell sentinels and added iron
giant. Each of those monsters are also emphasized in other sets.
Negative: Eventual emphasis on shadow dragons, revenants, black suns,
profane servitors, and shadow fiends.
Holy: Eventual emphasis on daevas and pearl dragons.
Chaos: Extra eventual emphasis on pandemonium lords.
Giants: Eventual emphasis on titans, iron giants, and juggernauts.
Dragons: Eventual emphasis on iron dragons, shadow dragons,
quicksilver dragons, and golden dragons.
Draconians: Eventual emphasis on the classed draconians.
Ranged: Cut thorn hunters (their briar patches hardly help); eventual
emphasis on stone giants, naga sharpshooters, merfolk javelineers,
and deep elf master archers.
Conjurers: Eventual emphasis on draconian annihilators.
Pan: No longer limited by depth, as there are plenty of nasty sets
already not limited by depth. Eventual emphasis on classed demonspawn
and greater demons.
Lair branches: Eventual emphasis on greater nagas, tentacled
monstrosities, merfolk javelineers, and ghost moths.

Ziggurats, of course, are not anywhere near done under this shift. The
floor shapes could use some tweaking and added variety (especially with
horizontal hexagon levels being noticeably too small for the monster
caps), and there are plenty of plausible pillar / entry changes. There's
some inherent inconsistency with the set scaling, any given thematic
range only supporting so much, and depth-scaling is inconsistently
applied as well based on current balances and supporting the
initially-weak sets. Still. This shift should be good enough, barring
tweaks and complete revisions.","<p dir=""auto"">[regret-index says:]</p>

floor shapes could use some tweaking and added variety (especially with<br>
horizontal hexagon levels being noticeably too small for the monster<br>
caps), and there are plenty of plausible pillar / entry changes. There's<br>
some inherent inconsistency with the set scaling, any given thematic<br>
range only supporting so much, and depth-scaling is inconsistently<br>
applied as well based on current balances and supporting the<br>
initially-weak sets. Still. This shift should be good enough, barring<br>

be off-balance or trip/stumble, etc. so he's briefly vulnerable to your stabber

right from testing it vs. orc and vaults.

a strong feeling about randart power balance. It's certainly better than any

Frilled lizards have SPELL_SPRINT, very slightly more HP, and slightly different spawn ranges. They move in bursts, but they attack at speed 10, so they shouldn't be deadlier than newts were. Their movement should be noticeable, and teaches new players that certain monsters can have unique movement patterns.

MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0ODc1NzY5Mjk=,4,Controlling Crawl's Curses Color Conjectures,"Controlling Crawl's Curses Color Conjectures
Goals
Allow control over the assumptions crawl makes when using curses character attributes to render bright colors.
Assume the worst by default; make sure characters are always visible on an 8-color terminal.
Motivation:
Crawl currently uses a 16-color palette internally for foregrounds and backgrounds.  In console mode, an 8-color curses palette is used, with bright foreground and background colors displayed using the WA_BOLD and WA_BLINK attributes, respectively.
 
However, many terminal emulators do not brighten the background when WA_BLINK is set, and cannot be easily configured to do so.  For example, XTerm actually implements blinking, and the alternative WA_BLINK handling is either ignore the attribute or treat as WA_BOLD.  So, when running crawl, XTerm effectively supports 16 foreground colors but only 8 background colors.
So, a bright background color will look the same as base background color on such a terminal.  Crawl does not detect this situation, leading to such characters being rendered as solid blocks of color.  Things only worsen on a terminal with only 8-color support across the board.
 
Additionally, consider the initial configuration of many terminal emulators. The user should not need to fine-tune their terminal to avoid invisible characters.  However, the user should be able to configure the game to explicitly assume full 16/16 color support, if desired.
It's safe to underestimate the terminal by default, but not safe to overestimate it by default.  Crawl currently overestimates or otherwise expects implementation-specific behavior for the terminal.
The patch:
This patch has a few major parts:
First, consider a character with identically-displayed foreground and background colors a failure condition.  Perform a fail-safe substitution for the foreground color if this occurs.
Next, allow independent run-time options to control the assumptions that WA_BOLD and WA_BLINK will actually affect the terminal's foreground and background colors.  Assume the worst by default: that the character attributes will not result in any change to the base curses color.  Effectively, assume we may be running on 8-color terminal.  When running with these defaults on a 16/16-color terminal, the palette is reduced but brights are not completely eliminated.
Also, fully extend the existing ""no_dark_brand"" option to cover all bright black output.  The remaining 15 colors can be output for 16-color terminals with broken bright black colors, provided the requisite attribute assumptions are enabled.
Last, add support for direct 16-color mode.  That is, use the terminal's 16-color palette directly instead of setting WA_BLINK/WA_BOLD character attributes.  The ""no_dark_brand"" is still respected in this mode.
Expected output:
Defaults on various terminals:
  
With matched settings for capable terminals:
 
New/adjusted option summary:

blink_brightens_background=false
Assume WA_BLINK gives a bright background.
bold_brightens_foreground=false
Assume WA_BOLD gives a bright foreground.
best_effort_brighten_background=true
If true, try to brighten the background using WA_BLINK even if blink_brightens_background is set to false.
best_effort_brighten_foreground=true
If true, try to brighten the foreground using WA_BOLD even if bold_brightens_foreground is set to false.
no_dark_brand=true
Assume darkgrey looks exactly the same as black.
allow_extended_colours=false
Use the terminal's extended palette directly, if possible.
background_colour=black
Try to set the terminal's default background colour.
If successful, reverse map to passed colour to black.
foreground_colour=lightgrey
Try to set the terminal's default foreground colour.
If successful, reverse map the passed colour to lightgrey.

Additional changes/fixes/notes:


Fully implement support for reverse-mapped default foreground and background colour options.


Adjust flip_colour() to preserve bright colors.


Compensate for darkgrey-on-black's likely adjustment to blue-on-black.
The adjustment is mainly to keep contrast between darkgrey-on-black and lightgrey-on-black when assuming the worst about the terminal's color capabilities.
The importance of keeping this contrast is most easily noticeable with the
darken_beyond_range set to true (the default).
The skill menu's colors have been adjusted to compensate for this change.


Testing:
Tested on the linux console, XTerm, xfce4-terminal, and PuTTY.
A termcast session was observed for testing default color interactions.
Example showcase: canarycrawl
Relevant rc-file contents:

And the commit msg for the change:
Distribute the weapon skill points to fighting (4), dodging (4), and
stealth (4). This results in Monks starting with the highest fighting and
dodging in the game, and tied for the highest stealth, but no weapon or
related skills.

Previous rationale for moving to a weapon choice start was that having such a
high skill investment into UC disallowed experimentation. But having weapon
choice results in Monks playing far too much like weaker Gladiators. This change
mirrors the Monks' saved-up piety: starting with high generalist fighting skills
is essentially saved up xp to be used toward a weapon of choice, once one is
taken from the floor or an enemy. Though many melee characters start by focusing
weapon skill anyways, Monks should see a better return on this strategy given
that their supporting skills begin at a higher point.

Flavor wise, this fits the idea of a monk who has trained their body for health
and discipline, but has not studied a particular weapon. Imagine an ascetic
stepping foot into the wrong cave, and being thrown into an adventure. Gameplay
wise, it gives a truly different starting experience from Fi/Gl/Hu in the
starting levels, and it jives corresponds well to the piety gimmick, in that it
is a boost to power *once a condition has been met* (finding an altar, finding a
weapon).

In the majority of cases, this should be a buff. Monks go from 11 skill points
total to 12, and skills are at higher levels, which are more valuable. As soon
as a monk picks up any weapon, they should be in a better place than old monks.
Further, this is a buff in the case that one quickly finds a good weapon which
is different from the type chosen at chargen (0 wasted xp). In the first ~30
turns, this is a nerf to survivability, requiring maximal use of the newly
buffed dodge and stealth.

Any feedback is much appreciated.","<p dir=""auto"">Some context may be found here: <a href=""https://crawl.develz.org/tavern/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=23161"" rel=""nofollow"">https://crawl.develz.org/tavern/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=23161</a></p>

The argument that swayed me to make a branch: ""One great effect of
getting rid of chance_breaks is that spells transition from 100% to 99%
to 98% etc. etc. earlier, instead of staying at 100% for ages and then
quickly falling. A 99% fail spell is still useless but it makes it much
easier for unspoiled players to tell how close they are to getting it
castable, compared to seeing both level 5 and level 9 spells as 100%
fail.""

feelings about introducing doubles where there were only wholesome ints,

Upon entering, the player has to follow a path that suddenly widens and leads to a clearing in the forest where a few secretive shopkeepers have settled down and are offering their wares. After a successful shopping trip, the player can resume their voyage to follow the path out of the forest and the bazaar.
This vault contains 3 to 4 normal shops (one is abandoned half the time) and one that is always abandoned.
Note: I don't know what type of bazaar vault is more useful at the moment (common or more rare ones), so I've taken 5 as a somewhat rare WEIGHT. I have in the meantime made antique shops more likely to appear to justify this. I guess it could arguably also be made very rare (if this pull request makes it in, anyway) as it differs from most/all of the other bazaar layouts in that it has no regular or symmetrical shape.

MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTI3NjkwNjU5,4,Stop diagonal running when encountering doors,"Consider the following scenario:

   #
   +#
     #
      #

When running SE, the player will just pass the door without stopping. This happens for any of the 4 diagonal directions.
This is due to the methods checking only the tiles to the left and the right relative to the movement direction. When moving horizontally or vertically, this does suffice. In the above example (and analogously for other diagonal movement) however, ""left"" means the directional vector (1,0), and ""right"" is (0,1). So when trying to find out whether the movement should stop, only the wall tiles are actually checked and the door isn't, even though it's passed by the player.
To fix this (in case it needs fixing), I've added another check that runs after the usual ""left"" and ""right"" ones and that is only executed if the player is moving diagonally. It is testing the ""far-left"" and ""far-right"" directions specifically, that is, perpendicular to the movement direction.
This check is only handling the exact case of ""passing a door""; that is, only doors are tested for. It can easily be extended to include other features the player should stop at though.
The reason I didn't incorporate those ""far-left"" and ""far-right"" tiles into the run_check array is because then the diagonal movement would stop way more often and it could be considered annoying.

MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTM1NDg0NzEw,4,Fix Incorrectly grayed-out spells in casting menu (#11180),"See https://crawl.develz.org/mantis/view.php?id=11180
This issue was caused by: 1756668
When refactoring the code in spl-book.cc to Gray out spells that the player is not able to learn (not enough spell levels or too low XL), the function, spell_highlight_by_utility, in spl-util.cc wasn't properly modified to handle being used by both the spell memorisation menu and the spell casting menu (which was the only thing that used it previously).
I thought of 2 options.

revert the refactoring. Move the check back to spl-book.cc.
modify spell_highlight_by_utility in spl-util.cc to accept an additional boolean argument indicating if a check against being able to memorise the spell is requested (similar to the existing boolean to check if the spell is situationally useless).

This PR implements option 2, but I would appreciate some feedback on whether this is the preferred option. I assumed it would be better for a single function to handle spell name highlighting.
Additionally, when calling spell_highlight_by_utility from spl-book.cc, rather than passing 'false,true' for the boolean parameters, I created a couple variables, which increased the else block from 1 line to 5 (since it needed braced). I don't know if this is the preferred style or if it's better to just pass the raw boolean values.

Currently, self-haloing prevents !invis, even when umbraed.

MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTM0Mjk2MTc1,4,Skill UI updates,"This PR is for tracking some skill UI changes I'm working on as they progress, feedback is welcome.
Initial commit:
This adds information in the following format to weapon/shield info
about when the player will reach mindelay/no penalty (where the first
two lines were already there):
This weapon's minimum attack delay (0.7) is reached at skill level 26.
     (Your skill: 20.8)
At max training you would reach 26.0 in about 1.0 XLs.
At current training (50%) you will reach 26.0 in about 2.3 XLs.

The basic idea is that this information allows more informed training
allocations at any given point.  I decided to use XLs as a measure
because I think players generally seem to have sense of XL progression,
and for most of the game it's something they're very attuned to.  Past
XL 27 it will say ""the equivalent of N XLs"", similar to how felid life
gain works.  Also, I couldn't think of any other way to quantify this.
Using XLs does to some degree reveal the amount of deep weirdness and
non-linearity in skill point / XL gain, but so be it.
In most cases this is an exact calculation, but there are a few things I
wasn't able to perfectly account for.  Crosstraining works, but it won't
take into account training multiple cross-training skills at the same
time.  Ash bonuses are approximate, because they give a skill point
bonus that is dependent on skill level (level, not points), and this is
somewhat hard to calculate.  It also uses only current ash piety.  It
ignores draining, ash penance, heroism, and any other skill effects I
forgot about.
This commit comes with a bunch of refactoring of skill / skill point
calculations in order to avoid code duplication and make some
calculations slightly clearer.  This commit is (hopefully) the first
step in a bunch of changes to the skill UI, including skill targets.
For example, the code that produces the weapon info is set up to support
arbitrary queries for skill targets.","<p dir=""auto"">This PR is for tracking some skill UI changes I'm working on as they progress, feedback is welcome.</p>

MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjA0OTE4NTUx,4,Fix the spell targeter for Gell's Gravitas,"This is inspired by the Tavern post made by Doesnt outlining the targeter's problems, which can be found here: https://crawl.develz.org/tavern/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=25497&p=329839&hilit=gell%27s#p329839
Previously, the formula used to calculate the targeted area was
completely different to that which the spell itself used, resulting in
the targeter blatantly lying to the player about the tiles which could
and could not be affected.
The current behaviour of Gell's Gravitas is entirely predictable based
on spell power, with no randomness involved, therefore the new targeter
is entirely in the darker yellow colour to indicate the certainty. The
power breakpoints are:
>0 power: at radius 1 from the centre, the monster is pulled 1 tile;
>0 power: at radius 2, the monster is pulled 1 tile;
>60 power: at radius 2, the monster is pulled 2 tiles; and
>80 power: at radius 3, the monster is pulled 1 tile.
The previous spell targeter suggested that, at low power levels,
monsters at radius 2 could never be affected, and that at exceptionally
high power levels, targets at radius 4 could be affected, both of which
are incorrect. Hence, this commit changes the targeter to reflect the
fact that monsters at radius 2 are always affected and monsters at
radius 3 are always affected when, and only when, above 80 power.
An argument could be made for having the targeted tile (the centre of
the ""gravitational reorientation"") not appear coloured, given that this
tile is not affected, however this would require significantly more
work.
This commit removes the gravitas_range function, which was previously
only used for making the targeter, because it is no longer required.
Additionally, this commit removes the player's tile being highlighted,
given the player is never affected.
Note: the new targeter does not change at 60 power, because the radius that is affected does not change. An argument could be made for having tiles at radius 2 be pale yellow to indicate that enemies are not dragged right to the centre when below 60 piety (and similarly for tiles at radius 3 above 80 piety).

(I've done my best to make sure this feature doesn't already exist; if I missed it, I'll be very sad)
This PR adds a password request function to the webtiles server. A user can open the forgot password form to request a reset link in their email. When they click on the link, they are sent back to the server with a unique parameter that allows them to enter a new password. Of course, an SMTP server is required to send the emails.
I've only tested this as much as I had to to keep working on it. I'm very new to this project, and I am also new to Python and SQLite. I understand that this PR may never be merged, but please give feedback where you can. I would like to learn everything I can from this. I do have a couple of comments that I would most like addressed:

Are usernames unique in the webtiles password DB? I did not notice any unique constraint
Are emails unique?
Is there a better way to know the host (URL and port) from within the server? I added it as a config option ""lobby_url""
I was not able to test the Python SMTP function over SSL I've done this
I also was not able to test the Python SMTP Login function, and as a result I'm not sure if the config values I added are enough I've done this
Is it important that I check to guarantee that the secret key is unique before sending it via email?

These things are bothering me:


What is the proper way to arrive at the password reset form, after the user clicks the link in their email? I added a dialog INSIDE the go_lobby function because this was the only way I could get it to work, but something about this feels wrong. The socket is loaded in its entirety while you're entering your new password, but I have to completely reload the page in order to get rid of the secret key parameter, so the socket is loaded twice for no reason


This PR adds two new columns in the database. I added the columns to the 'ensure_user_db_exists' function, but what about servers that already have a database? I included a .sql file that will upgrade an existing database, but I don't know how this is normally done.

A consequence is that Animate Dead becomes slightly stronger, as a
player could now butcher every corpse for nutrition and then animate the
skeleton, at the expense of a few HD for the undead minions. This isn't
actually a buff, though, because said hypothetical player can already walk to
each corpse and cast animate skeleton for an almost identical effect

MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTk4NTQ4OTEw,4,Attempt God conversions on sight.,"Currently three gods change monster attitudes on sight: Beogh, Gozag
(under bribe), and Jiyva.
When a player sees a monster, Gozag and Jiyva have already decided
whether they will convert the monster, but prior to this patch the
conversion did not happen until the player took an action with the
monster in LOS. This led to an unfortunate bug in the following
situation: if a bribed monster walked into LOS of a player bribing a
branch with Gozag no messaging would be displayed and the player could
attack the monster. This would have the effect of betraying the bribe
and turn any bribed monsters in LOS hostile for what appeared to be no
reason to the player. (The problem is less severe under Jiyva since not
attacking slimes is part of the conduct, but it does cause the
occasional 'hostile' slime to appear.)
Beogh's conversion behavior is different, and requires the monster be
awake, clear-headed, and targeting the player. As a result this check
needs to happen every turn the orc is reacting to the player (Beogh sets
a flag to make only one conversion attempt per-orc).
This patch makes conversion attempts happen in both relevant code-paths
using a do_conversions() function. While this causes some minor
execution duplication, each conversion function handles being called
multiple times on the same monster correctly, and abstracting the
conversion attempts to attitude-change make it easier to keep track of
them for the future (however unlikely more ally religions are).
I'm fixing the bug this way and not by changing how gozag_break_bribe
operates to avoid the mini-game of ""I won't attack this monster that
just walked into my LOS in case I'm about to bribe it"". The Beogh
conversion rules should probably be re-thought as their current state
has a bit of this mini-game.","<p dir=""auto"">Currently three gods change monster attitudes on sight: Beogh, Gozag<br>
(under bribe), and Jiyva.</p>
<p dir=""auto"">When a player sees a monster, Gozag and Jiyva have already decided<br>
whether they will convert the monster, but prior to this patch the<br>
conversion did not happen until the player took an action with the<br>
monster in LOS. This led to an unfortunate bug in the following<br>
situation: if a bribed monster walked into LOS of a player bribing a<br>
branch with Gozag no messaging would be displayed and the player could<br>
attack the monster. This would have the effect of betraying the bribe<br>
and turn any bribed monsters in LOS hostile for what appeared to be no<br>
reason to the player. (The problem is less severe under Jiyva since not<br>
attacking slimes is part of the conduct, but it does cause the<br>
occasional 'hostile' slime to appear.)</p>
<p dir=""auto"">Beogh's conversion behavior is different, and requires the monster be<br>
awake, clear-headed, and targeting the player. As a result this check<br>
needs to happen every turn the orc is reacting to the player (Beogh sets<br>
a flag to make only one conversion attempt per-orc).</p>
<p dir=""auto"">This patch makes conversion attempts happen in both relevant code-paths<br>
using a do_conversions() function. While this causes some minor<br>
execution duplication, each conversion function handles being called<br>
multiple times on the same monster correctly, and abstracting the<br>
conversion attempts to attitude-change make it easier to keep track of<br>
them for the future (however unlikely more ally religions are).</p>
<p dir=""auto"">I'm fixing the bug this way and not by changing how gozag_break_bribe<br>

MSVC doesn't like implicit use of && and ""filter"". Can probably be solved with good code. Change is a hack and shouldn't be used.

player-reacts.cc

spl-transloc.h

MSVC had trouble telling the difference between this and std::disjunction. My change is a hack. Consider a different name, or a convention?

MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjI4ODI5Njc4,4,Add a prompt for attacking living things while under divine protection,"Killing natural monsters while under Elyvilon's divine protection causes
penance. However, there is no prompt for this, and it seems natural
for the player to invoke divine protection when low on HP so they don't
die, then heal up, and once they've healed, try to fight the enemy
causing them trouble. It was easy for players to accidentally cause
penance by killing enemies while under divine protection in this way.
Hence, add a prompt for attacking natural monsters while divine
protection is active. Penance will not actually trigger until the

One thing: attacks like this do not necessarily cause penance; they only do so if the monster is killed by the attack. Is it therefore appropriate to display the line ""This attack would place you under penance!"" in the prompt? For now, I have assumed that it is, even though it is not guaranteed.","<p dir=""auto"">Killing natural monsters while under Elyvilon's divine protection causes<br>
penance. However, there is no prompt for this, and it seems natural<br>
for the player to invoke divine protection when low on HP so they don't<br>
die, then heal up, and once they've healed, try to fight the enemy<br>
causing them trouble. It was easy for players to accidentally cause<br>
penance by killing enemies while under divine protection in this way.</p>
<p dir=""auto"">Hence, add a prompt for attacking natural monsters while divine<br>
protection is active. Penance will not actually trigger until the<br>

MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTczODE4NzM3,4,Improve the text on gaining and losing god abilities and for god abilities on the ^ screen,"Improve the text printed to the message log when gaining or losing a
piety level and the text displayed on the god overview screen ^ such
that:

all text printed when the player gains a piety level contains the
word ""now"", and is written either with ""can"", ""will"" or similar,
or in the continuous present tense,
e.g. ""Kiku is now protecting you from torment"";
all text printed when the player loses a piety level contains the
words ""no longer"", and is written with either ""can"" or ""will"" or
something similar,
e.g. ""Kiku will no longer protect you from torment"";
all text on the ^ screen uses either ""can"" or the present tense,
e.g. ""Kiku protects you from torment"".

This removes all poor constructions involving the use of the
continuous present on the ^ screen, and the continuous present without
the word ""now"" on gaining abilities - an example of this was
""Vehumet is aiding your destructive magics"", which becomes
""Vehumet is now aiding ..."" on gaining 2* of piety, and
""Vehumet aids ..."" on the ^ screen.
This is done by adding a new variable general to the god_power struct,
to differentiate between the text on the ^ screen and the text on
gaining the ability, which were previously the same unless the
""You can "" construction was being used.
Also add messages for when Trog and Okawaru begin granting ammunition
gifts and when Jiyva begins granting corrosion resistance.
Also break several lines in the definition of the god_powers vector that
went beyond 80 characters because multiple parameters were placed on a
single line, or that did or did not go beyond 80 characters and had more
than two parameters split over two lines. This aims to improve
readability.
Finally, add a description of the ""You can [now /no longer ]""

different way, to religion.h.

Improvements to make seeding more stable cross-platform (tested on linux vs os x, but not yet on windows): before, vault choice was partly determined by how OS calls provided the .des file order, now, it should be stable (as long as the vault list is the same).
Pregeneration, based more-or-less on belrogue/crawl-better-dd@master...belrogue:seeded_crawl. However, this is implemented in a way that should generate levels cleanly, without various side-effects of the player entering them, and doesn't rely on wizmode calls. Also, there is a UI element that indicates to the user that generation is happening. (Not yet implemented for webtiles.)

Most pregen/seeding features are disabled or hidden for online play; separate game modes for that will come later. (You can see the seed of a dead character, though.)","<p dir=""auto"">This branch implements improvements to seeding behavior, as well as optional dungeon pregeneration for (hopefully) stable seed-&gt;dungeon mappings.</p>

Ozocubu's Refrigeration has been one third of what it should be,
specifically 3d((5 + power/10)/3), leading to a very underwhelming

number of sides on each die by the number of dice.

however a calcdice_calculator is preferred for the fact that it randomly
rounds power/N instead of always using integer division (which creates
minor breakpoints). Therefore this commit instead fixes the damage by

MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjY0MTUyNzQ5,4,Don't place shafts in ebering_ghost_disaster_area (11926),"This commit prevents the vaults ebering_ghost_disaster_area and
ebering_vaults_ghost_disaster_area from placing shaft traps, instead
placing only water and lava tiles, implementing option 2 in 11926.
This change is to prevent ghosts in these vaults from being shafted
immediately when they enter line of sight of the player, before the
player can do anything to stop this.
These vaults were introduced by commits bb431e2 and a6a7277
respectively, and appear to have been introduced with the idea that
ghosts cannot be shafted. Ghosts can now be shafted, as of 8c2e593, and
this means that these vaults in particular could cause ghosts to be
shafted to lower floors, leaving behind an empty (or mostly empty) ghost
vault for the player to raid, and allowing the ghost to be encountered
outside of its vault on a lower floor, with the player then unable to
choose whether to fight the ghost.
I suggested three other courses of action in 11926: revert 8c2e593, remove these vaults altogether, and come up with some special-cased solution to prevent these ghosts being shafted. I came to the conclusion that the option to remove the shafts from these vaults was the most appropriate solution, and hence I have implemented it in this PR.

http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/httputil.html#tornado.httputil.HTTPServerRequest.remote_ip
Commit message reproduced below:

This change allows webtiles to accurately log IP addresses when it is
running behind a reverse proxy.
Webtiles logs IP addresses when users connect to the server. This is
done by looking at the value of 'request.remote_ip', provided by
Tornado. When webtiles is running behind a reverse proxy, the value
returned by Tornado is the IP address of the proxy itself. This does not
uniquely identify users and results in a mostly useless log file.
This commit looks for the new setting 'http_xheaders' in config.py and,
if it is found, passes it along to Tornado.HTTPServer. When HTTPServer
is initialized with this setting, request.remote_ip will instead return
the value of header X-Real-IP if it is present. This header can be set
by a reverse proxy to indicate the actual IP of the real client.
Be warned that enabling this option when webtiles is NOT protected
behind a reverse proxy introduces a security risk. An attacker could
inject a false address into the X-Real-IP header. Do not enable this
option if the webtiles server is directly exposed to users.","<p dir=""auto"">This change has been tested on a local dev environment with and without a reverse proxy.

MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjkzMzkzNDc1,4,Incremental pregen,"I'm still doing a bunch of testing but this is getting close to a merge, so I'll PR it in case anyone else has time to look.
This PR uses a single standard levelgen mechanism that is intended to be stable across devices etc given a seed: incremental pregeneration. The core problem is that levelgen choices are not independent between levels, so the order in which levels are generated heavily impacts later parts of the dungeon, something that can't be mitigated by fancier rng seeding (for example, many vaults can only place once). What this new levelgen technique does is generate all levels in a stable order, but only as many as needed to catch up when entering a new level. So, for example, if you fall through a shaft and skip a level, it will generate the skipped level first. Some cases are a bit heavier; e.g. if you enter depths before lair, the game will generate lair and both lair branches entirely before depths 1. This technique supposed to get (almost) exactly the same results as full pregeneration, but without the up front CPU cost.
The main case where incremental pregen can differ from full pregeneration involves unrandarts. This is because there are various ways for the player to get unrands at any point in the game, and so there's no practical way to avoid things like acquirement being able to scoop an artifact that on a full pregeneration run would try to place later in the game. What these changes do instead are systemize the code (which already sort of existed) for placing similar randarts where an unrand should've placed but couldn't, as well as isolate the rng calculations from this from the main levelgen rng. The impact of acquiring an unrand in this kind of case should then amount to a change in just one item later.
This PR also includes various improvements to the RNG API, bugfixes, etc.","<p dir=""auto"">I'm still doing a bunch of testing but this is getting close to a merge, so I'll PR it in case anyone else has time to look.</p>

MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0Mjg4Mjg5MjYz,4,Fix display of detected gold on the minimap (11950),"Currently, there are several Gold Sense-related bugs:

on webtiles, detected gold is not displayed on the minimap;
on local tiles, it disappears from the minimap after reloading the
game and after reentering a floor;
on console, it's not possible to scroll the map in the X mode to see
all detected piles of gold on a new level.

This happens because now update_item_at() runs more than once for each
pile of gold.
Prior to 063869c, the gold detection code from files.cc:_count_gold(),
which contains update_item_at(), run only once for each new level.
After that commit and after 4488db6, the gold detection code, which is
now in god-passive.cc:gozag_detect_level_gold(), runs twice when the
player enters a new floor. First, it runs as a delayed action, then it
runs for counting the generated gold (both calls come from
files.cc:load_level()).
When it's called the first time, gozag_detect_level_gold() sets the
MAP_DETECTED_ITEM flag for each pile of gold, so they would appear on
the minimap. When gozag_detect_level_gold() called after that,
clear_item() removes this flag from the piles, and, since
env.map_knowledge() already knows about those piles,

The code path is god-passive.cc:gozag_detect_level_gold() ->
show.cc:update_item_at() -> map-cell.h:set_item() ->
map-cell.h:clear_item().
Unlike webtiles, local tiles update the minimap only after the first
call, so detected gold appears on the minimap, but only until a current
level is reloaded.
This commit makes it safe to call gozag_detect_level_gold() multiple
times: update_item_at() will be called only for undetected piles of
gold.

Abyss regions are displayed too.","<p dir=""auto"">Currently, there are several Gold Sense-related bugs:</p>

MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzczNDg2NDIy,4,New single-use item: Shattersphere,"Shatterspheres are single-use evocables that cause a radius 2 explosion at
range 3. Their explosion is skewed by 1 tile from the target, so they always
have at least a 1/3 chance of hitting the player. However, since they do
6d12 BEAM_FRAG damage, players with 20-25 AC will usually take little to
no damage. (BEAM_FRAG checks 3x AC.) As such, this is intended to be a fun
toy for well-armoured characters and a desperation option for others.
A design space that I've wanted to explore for many years is the
'3x AC' damage type (ala LRD and the late, lamented Orb of Fragmentation).
I initially tried to make it into a spell, but it's very much the opposite
of the modern Earth school philosophy and in general makes more sense as a
tool for armoured, less-spell-focused characters.
Other notes:

The targeter intentionally doesn't prompt that you might hit yourself;
that's guaranteed.
Shatterspheres use V and let you train evocations, but they aren't
affected by evocations skill at all. (This is because increased damage
is arguably a downside, since it means your AC might not be able to
soak it.) Some possible fixes: turn it into a multi-use item ala box of
beasts and have evocations skill change odds of it breaking; add a fail
chance (though the UI is bad); turn it into a quivered, thrown item (but
the code for this seems much trickier).

Previously, this formula gave you a significant higher chance of triggering a paralysis or painbond event per aut if you were taking shorter actions:
0 auts remaining on TIMER:
10 aut turn => 0.01 events/aut
5 aut turn => 0.02 events/aut
200 auts remaining on TIMER:
10 aut turn => 0.0033 events/aut
5 aut turn => 0.004 events/aut
This incentivizes doing fast actions whenever you have to wait at higher piety instead of simply resting. It's even optimal when enemies are out of sight, since a paralysis/pain bond event triggering when no enemies are in sight resets the relevant TIMER to 0.
The new formula makes the expected value of events proportional to the duration of the turn, and so eliminates all turn-length dependence except for rounding errors. Event rates are all set to the same as with 10 aut actions previously, regardless of action length.

MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0Mzg1ODUxMTAw,4,Added room for tactics to vaults in simple.des,"This file is also intended as a tutorial of sorts for reading vaults, so I attempted to keep changes I made as syntactically simple as possible. This was most impactful in some of the large vaults (eg erik_arrival_triangle_huge) which needed the first few rooms marked no_monster_gen; I made the entire vault no_monster_gen rather than introduce a KMASK in such cases to retain their syntactic simplicity.
Vault list:
minmay_arrival_wavy_path: Single path, single exit vault. I added a second exit with a door.
matt_arrival_spirals: Two of the three starting locations could have you trapped by a randomly generated monster. Adding no_monster_gen allows the player to get to the main corridor, with multiple exits, prior to finding monsters.
lemuel_arrival_funnel: The island in the center of this vault had a 1:8 chance of being removed. In that case, this vauls was single-path, single-exit. I removed that possibility from the SUBST list.
minmay_arrival_pointy: Single path, single exit. I added a corridor between the points, which should allow you some tactical flexibility.
dpeg_arrival_radiant: This had a change to generate a single exit; I changed it to guaranteeing two. I also fixed what appeared to be a typo making the top-right path have two chances to be closed off, instead of one like the rest of the paths.
dpeg_arrival_tiny_i/j/k: These have the potential (or guaranteed for k) for the left end of the path to be blocked off by mapgen (making it single exit.) I added an escape hatch in case that happened.
dpeg_arrival_windows_large_door: Single-exit room. I added a door to one of the back corners (which corner will be randomized by vault-flipping.)
erik_arrival_triangle_small/medium/large/huge: All of these have the potential for a monster to be generated in one of the first 3 rooms, before you have any interconnectivity or options. I marked these vaults as no_monster_gen; possibly they should be moved out of this file and a KMASK applied to just the first 3 rooms.
minmay_arrival_plants_in_alcoves: Single path, single exit. I added an island made of plants/fungus/bushes/trees to the center.
noname_arrival_rooms_in_the_neighbourhood: This one was single-exit rooms, and was missing the SHUFFLE statement to make it possible to spawn in each room. I added a second exit to each room and the SHUFFLE statement, and moved it to small.des since the header was too long for simple.des.
onia_arrival_mini_spirals: This one had 4 paths with no interconnection and a single exit. I added a door connecting two of the paths and marked it as no_monster_gen to avoid a monster spawning in one of the initial spirals.
zelgadis_glass_arrival_small: This has guaranteed islands outside of the spiral. I added no_monster_gen to avoid monsters spawning and blocking the initial spiral.
dpeg_arrival_snail: Single path, single exit. I added a door to allow the player to generate a pillar in the center of the spiral while maintaining the current auto-explore spiral path.
ncdulo_halloftheorcs: Single exit room into the rest of the vault with monster_gen on. I added a second exit to the room (facing the same direction to give the player a similar first time experience.)
tarquinn_simple_flora_water_a: Single path, single exit. I removed the tree that kept you from walking around it.
tarquinn_simple_flora_water_c: Each side is single path, single exit unless pool_fixup creates a shallow water path across. I added a second exit to each side (and eliminated a meaningless A in the second subst.)
tarquinn_simple_flora_water_e: Single exit room. I added two more exits.
saegor_arrival_simple_d: Single exit room, and no handy way to add an exit without changing the aesthetics. I added an escape hatch instead.
scummos_arrival_gate: Single path into a single exit room. I added pillars of shallow water and lava to the sides of the path.
lightli_molten_gateway: Single exit room, and no handy way to add an exit without changing the aesthetics. I added an escape hatch instead.
mrwooster_arrival_statue_2/3: Open alcove design. I added a couple statues to the center to give the player something to work with tactically.
wheals_arrival_linesprint: Single path, single exit. I added a door connecting two parts of the 'line-sprint'.
wheals_arrival_shading: Room with a single exit. I added a couple islands.
lightli_arrival_flooded_house: Single path, single exit. I added a second exit.
giann_wishing_wells: This vault had a single exit with a plain antechamber; not much you could do aside from retreat to one of the sides. I added a couple more entrances to the antechamber.
psy_arrival_conway: This vault actually had two shallow water exits (one toward the top and one toward the bottom) which could be used for pretty interesting tactics. However, it's not clear without fully exploring which of the 4 alcoves are dead ends and which have a path, which makes this spoilery. I added a third path across which ensures that no matter which way you run, you'll find a path before you have to commit to an alcove.
psy_arrival_dodecagon: This vault had a 50% chance to be a single exit room. I added a second guaranteed exit.
psy_arrival_heroes: This was a single exit room. I added a couple more hero statues which could be used as pillars or chokepoints as needed.
wander_arrival_desolate: This vault is essentially just empty space. Odds are that this will be fine, since D:1 mapgen will probably put multiple entrances to it, but that's dependent on the current choice of map generator for D:1. Just in case, I added an escape hatch. I also applied the 'desolate' floor tiling to the features (arch, fountains, dungeon-exit, and escape hatch.)
wander_arrival_chamber: Single exit room. I added two more exits.","<p dir=""auto"">This file is also intended as a tutorial of sorts for reading vaults, so I attempted to keep changes I made as syntactically simple as possible.

Unfortunately, it didn't remove enough of the old ones, leaving the amulet slot with a lot of clutter.
Scarves were introduced to offer a trade-off between AC and more powerful effects in the cloak slot, and also to soak up the old RMsl status and turn it into an item. However, the most powerful effect in the cloak slot remained +Invis which stayed on cloaks!
This batch of commits shuffles the egos around to try and line things up better. Cloaks gain stealth and rCorr (looking thin with just rPois and MR, but boots have almost no egos so maybe it's fine without these two). Scarves gain Invis and Harm and drop spirit (dups the amulet) and cloud immunity. Amulets get pruned, losing harm (not good in the amulet spot because the swap penalty doesn't actually prevent swapping), reflection and gourmand (the latter two for not really fitting with the stronger amulets).
Outstanding todos:

 Finalize decision on cloak egos (gammafunk expressed some reservation wrt duplicating rings).

MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDQ0NDMyMTg1,4,Remove spell hunger and chunk eating,"Spell hunger was meant to serve as a backstop limitation to medium term use of magic and the use of magic in conjunction with certain god abilities. However, except for very high level spells cast with low intelligence it was rarely relevant in the tactical scale. The spell hunger mechanic comes with a design cost: it necessitates a wide difference in food clock costs between magic and non-magic combat skills, leading to chunk eating and the attendantly loose food clock.
Removing spell hunger removes the major factor creating wide nutrition variance among characters, and makes it possible to remove chunk eating (except for Ghouls). Ghouls retain the ability because that's their thing. The remaining food conducts can be used for tweaking the (still very loose) food clock to adjust for species other mutations. Spriggans, with their move speed, seem to require this adjustment, accounted for by the herbivore nutrition penalty on rations.
Trolls lose their flavorful fast metabolism gourmand combo, which is a shame and perhaps could be restored, but in practice it didn't confine gameplay much for non-Gozag trolls. They retain fast metabolism 1 to account for their regeneration.
Hydra form now allows devouring up to Engorged for all species that can transmute.
I'm putting this branch up now to get the conversation rolling. Before landing it the following things still need to be addressed:

 Clean-up food.cc and butcher.cc because they're really much simpler now and a lot of old logic just isn't needed
 Remove god food conducts and their mentions, since Ghouls don't worship gods with food conduct
 Fix the Ghoul rot timer instead of having it vary (opaquely) with hunger level, end ration eating for ghouls.

a) It fired a Primal Wave at the target
b) It created a pool around the target
c) It waterlogged monsters in the pool
Primal Wave deals damage, potentially knocks back a tile, and creates its own pool. This led to phial of floods creating two different overlapping temporary pools, one waterlogged and the other not.
This commit consolidates everything into Primal Wave. Phial no longer manually creates its own pool; instead player-created Primal Waves now scale with power like the Phial pool did, and apply waterlogged appropriately.
This commit also reworks Primal Wave's pool generation. Previously, it created the center tile manually, and then randomly added tiles on a 2-radius circeLOS ring to it. I switched it to use the Phial pool generation method which uses a fair distance_iterator to fill the pool from the center. The results are fairly similar without the weird spoilery effects of circle-LoS math.
This commit also incidentally solves the issue where the actual target of the phial could be pushed out of the pool by the primal wave and miss getting waterlogged.

Specifics (where different from the design doc or where the design doc wasn't concrete)

Infusion was removed outright, didn't seem like it would be a good amulet
Song of Slaying reflavoured ""Wereblood"" and moved to Tmut (replacing S2S in the starter book), gives noise on kill instead of continuously.
Spectral Weapon becomes the ""spectral"" ego found on staves and clubs and (rarely) 2-handed randarts; flavored as bonding with the tree spirit still contained in the weapon's wood.
Ring of Flames becomes an amulet of flames, giving the spell's effect with the cloud ring scaling with evo.
Darkness becomes a scarf of shadows, reducing LOS and giving a spell de-enhancer
Ozocubu's armour works with all armour, the effect scales down with ER
Excruciating Wounds gives -Wiz and prevents unwielding for the duration.
Death's Door is single-school Level 9

Outstanding Issues/Tasks

 The amulet of flames might be too flashy for a mundane item and be better as an unrand. Discuss.
 Should artificers get a spectral club to start? (Pro: uses evo, cool, good flavour, unique, clubs aren't that good; Con: background is already strong with wands)
 Is Tm too weak without S2S as a crutch, and if so what should be done (if anything)?
 Beastly Appendage is ""good to always cast if you fight in melee"", fix it. (This may address the above).
 Finish the WIP battlesphere adjustments.
 Double check save compat with skill removal.

MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDU0MDA4Njgw,4,Zot branch bank,"The natural tendency for roguelikes is to encourage cautious behavior.
It's over once you die once, after all, so you should take your time.
That's not a bad thing, but to balance things out and discourage
extremely time-consuming tactics (which tend not to be very fun!),
it's good to have a counterpressure encouraging players to move quickly.
Food was intended to be such a clock, but for a variety of reasons, it
never worked as a clock for anything but the most egregious abuses.
(And not even for that for foodless races, of course.) Scores is a
compelling motivation for some players, but not many - most are just
playing to win. How can we make the most viable way to win also the
most fun?
This commit adds a new 'Zot Clock'. It ticks up over time, and jumps
down whenever you enter a new level - roughly 5000 turns of clock per
level. Once you hit turn 14,500 or so on the clock, the malevolent and
unexplained entity Zot strikes, draining you immediately and then again
once every 100 turns or so. At turn 15,000, you die. Each branch tracks
the 'clock' separately.
5000 turns per level allows for a 250,000 turn 3-rune game, which
seems very generous. The effective cap of 15,000 turns 'stored' at any
given time means that there's somewhat less slack than that implies,
but a slow character can usually do levels in under 2500 turns and
inter-level travel in under 500, so I'm hopeful that normal characters
will rarely if ever see any of this system.
We use 'levels seen' here as a proxy for progress because that's
simple to conceptualize and relatively difficult to abuse - it's hard
to ""stash"" entire levels as a clock reserve in the same way you could
stash ""unexplored map tiles"" or ""weak monsters"". The separate clock
per branch allows players to dip into branches and then bail without
being penalized - the per-branch clock is paused while they're away.
The clock is paused while you're in Abyss, since that doesn't fit the
exploration model well and isn't usually that wise to linger in, and
turned off entirely when you get the ORB, since (a) there's a new
clock then and (b) it'd feel awful to die of time-out on the orb run.
It's possible to scum Pan for time, but I mean, if you're scumming
Pan, just win already!
Chei gives you some extra time, in keeping with the theme of the
god. It's possible that races need different clocks based on their
movement speeds, but I'm hopeful that the difference there is fairly
small relative to the slack in the clock.

MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTI4MDYwNjcw,4,A small description fix and a story about known shafts,"This PR fixes Shaft Self description, because the ability has an equal chance of taking the player 1, 2, or 3 levels down.
Although all shafts work the same way now, the following still might be interesting.
The Unknown History of Known Shafts
Shafts became a single-use dungeon feature in 0.6. The same commit changed how shafts work: known shafts were supposed to send the player fewer floors down than unknown ones.
Unknown shafts had an equal chance to drop the player 1, 2, or 3 levels down. Known shafts, including Formicid-made ones, worked differently:



Version / chance
1 level
2 levels
3 levels




0.6 - 0.18
5/8
2/8
1/8


0.18 - 0.23
2/3
1/3
-



This lasted for several versions until the 0.23's trap reform replaced unknown shafts with exploration trap effects. Additionally, all shafts got an equal chance to send the player 1, 2, or 3 levels down.
But that initial 0.6 commit had a small bug that survived through all these years until its removal in 0.25.
A shaft's destination was calculated in traps.cc:generic_shaft_dest(level_pos lpos, bool known = false). Other code didn't use this function directly and called it only via a wrapper function (note-1):
level_id generic_shaft_dest(coord_def pos, bool known = false)
{
    return generic_shaft_dest(level_pos(level_id::current(), pos));
}
Because the wrapper didn't pass known into the actual function, the default value for known, false, was used all the time.
So, all 0.6 - 0.23 shafts, including Formicid-made ones, were considered unknown and always had an equal chance to take the player 1, 2, or 3 levels deeper.

Notes:

The function and its wrapper had the same name, and the only difference between them was the type of the first parameter. The function was renamed to _generic_shaft_dest later, which made it easier to notice that it was only called via a wrapper: grepping 0.11 source code for generic_shaft_dest.","<p dir=""auto"">This PR fixes Shaft Self description, because the ability has an equal chance of taking the player 1, 2, or 3 levels down.</p>

MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTYwNzMyNDE2,4,Remove Evocation scaling from Spectral,"Currently, the spectral brand is the most complex weapon ego in the game.
It has two significant drawbacks:

It can significantly increase the damage the wielder takes, since the
spectral weapon shares damage with the player.
It requires Evocations training to use.

Both due to the overall complexity and the perceived weakness of this
brand, I'm inclined to simplify by removing one of these effects. Pain
sharing makes the brand a bit harder to evaluate, since most brands have
no downside at all vs an unbranded weapon (chaos being the notable exception).
Evocations scaling has several other problems, though:

It confuses players on a regular basis. People miss the subtle messages about
'ineptitude' and fail to understand why the spectral weapon isn't triggering -
'is it broken?' Some of them ask other players and get the confusion sorted out
but others, presumably, just continue thinking it's bugged!
It's the only effect where Evocations training gives benefit to a passive effect,
rather than an evocable item or ability. This isn't the end of the world, but it
is an odd exception.
Evocations skill is currently very useful for most characters even without this

most games present a large number of powerful, Evocations-scaling items that
strongly incentivize Evocations training. It's somewhere between unuseful and
counterproductive to add one more.



It's possible that the damage sharing effect should also go away or be reduced
in magnitude - the downsides of ""need to mess with positioning"" and ""don't have

Goals

Make all monsters single spell book
Remove low level spells from high level monsters
Reduce reliance on overused spells
Replace generic summons with focused summons for stronger flavor

Summary of changes
Pain is the most notable low-level spell on high level monsters, it has been cleaned up, along with a look at the other level 1 damage spells used by monsters. Some hexes might also need looking at, but hexes remain impactful throughout the game.
There are a few more small spell book tweaks aimed at making monster books tighter theme wise.
Psyche gets a chaotic new spell set to replace the orc wizard book she previously had, which should be significantly more memorable.
The major change is converting most monsters to single spell book monsters in d5e8436. The commit message is copied into this PR in the section book changes.
Book changes
The general guiding principle I've followed when assembling the new
book is to try to follow the ""feel"" of the old book sets that a player
would get if they weren't checking each monster's book carefully.
Faun
The old Faun spellbooks were corona + another hex. There are a mix of
Will checking threats in shoals, but often players arrive with lots of
Will gear stacked up. Fauns show up in packs and their Corona+Hex book
was designed to make them amplify other ambient ranged threats. The new
book gives them Strip Willpower in place, for helping one another and other
ambient monsters hex the player.
New Faun book:

Corona
Strip Willpower

Deep Elf Knight
Deep Elf Knights had one book with Icicle, Haste, and Invisibility,
and a second which had Stone Arrow, Force Lance, and Invisibility.
The positional implications of Force Lance are great to keep around,
so it's added to the rest of the first book.
New Deep Elf Knight book:

Throw Icicle
Force Lance
Haste
Invisibility

Orc Wizard
Orc Wizards had three(!) distinct books, but their most iconic behavior
was confusing the player and going invisible. This is book II, shared
with Sigmund, and this is made into the single Orc Wizard book.
New Orc Wizard book:

Magic Dart
Throw Flame
Confuse
Invisibility

Blork
Blork the Orc used Orc Wizard book III, this is basiclly preserved but
emergency invisibility is removed from the book since it was quite long.
New Blork book:

Cantrip
Magic Dart
Throw Flame
Throw Frost
Haste

Necromancer
Necromancers had two books which differed only in the choice of bolt
spell. In a large fight where Bind Souls has produced many simulacra,
the player could hide from either bolt by using the simulacra to block
LOF. The new book gives Necromancers Bolt of Draining, which works
better with their mechanic.
New Necromancer book:

Bolt of Draining
Agony Range
Bind Souls
Invisibility

Wizard
Wizards' book assortment conveyed a mix of magics, to imply a mastery.
Based on the D&D class as far as I can tell. To keep that flavor I
picked a range of spells from their books that produced the same ""mixed
magic"" feel. They share depth with Ogre Magi but don't come in packs, so
I went with fireball and banishment here to differentiate the two spell
sets.
New Wizard book:

Fireball
Banishment
Blink
Invisibility

Hell Knight
Hell Knights are one of a couple of late game monsters that cast Pain,
which at their depth isn't much of a threat even when it can beat the
player's Will. Bolt of Fire is good for them, they can just use that.
Perhaps blink should be made non-emergency, but because Hell Knights
come in packs an injured HK blinking away to let a fresh one attack the
player is a nice touch.
New Hell Knight book:

Bolt of Fire
Blink (emergency)
Haste

Ancient Champion
Another late game monster with Pain. Since they often come in bands with
undead, retaining Bolt of Draining might be good but for now I went with
short and sweet.
New Ancient Champion book:

Iron Shot
Haste

Royal Mummy
Each of the four Royal Mummy books had Smite and Torment, the remaining
mixed Summon Demon, Summon Undead, Summon Mana Viper, Summon Emperor
Scorpions, and Summon Death Scarabs in some combination. Plain Summon
Demon doesn't do much for RMs, Vipers are also quite fragile at the time
Royal Mummies appear and vulnerable to torment, and Mummy Priests
already summon undead. Scorpions are vulnerable to torment, so they're
not the best here, but the flavour is good. Perhaps we could give
emperor scorps rTorm. This is the old Book IV, which has the strongest
Mummy flavour.
New Royal Mummy book:

Smite
Symbol of Torment
Summon Emperor Scorpions
Summon Death Scarabs

Ogre Mage
Ogre Mages typically come in packs with other Ogres and are notable for
hasting them. Beyond that they have a sort of wizard flavour to their
book set; this consolodation picks Bolt of Magma and Parlayse to round
out the set to differentiate them from Wizards which appear at
overlapping depth.
New Ogre Mage book:

Bolt of Magma
Haste Other
Paralyse
Invisibility

Tengu Conjurer
The different Tengu spellcasters have a hodgepodge of ""battlemage""
spells. Flavour wise Tengu are supposed to be good at Conjurations and
Air magic, so I settled on the air book from the four book choices.
New Tengu Conjurer book:

Lightning Bolt
Battlesphere
Blink

Tengu Reaver
In keeping with the air theme (though less so conjurations), the new
Tengu reaver book attempts to give them a pair of spells that force a
player trying to melee them to reposition. The monster AI change when it
comes to blocking ranged allies means that the reaver won't block its
lightning spire if it can step aside, so this should interact well. It
might need spell logic to prevent the reaver from summoning 10000 spires
since monsters don't have summon caps, let's see how it plays.
New Tengu Reaver book:

Freezing Cloud
Summon Lightning Spire

Liches
In merging spell books it was often easy to pick out the ""iconic"" spells and weave them together into a single book that still felt like the monster. For Liches, the list of ""iconic"" spells don't quite work together as a single book. Based on some of the input, I've gone with keeping Liches and Ancient lichee having the same book, a conjurations focussed book:

Corrosive Bolt
LCS
Haste
Slow
Invisibility

To complement this, since as nikheizen pointed out there's plenty of space on the L glyph, this branch introduces a new monster, draft name ""dread Lich"" (sorry I didn't go for the more ambitious names suggested). Dread Liches have the same stats as Ancient Liches, and appear in the same places (except for a couple of vaults that were using ancient liches specifically one way or another), with the spell book:

Haste
Summon Greater Demon
Paralyse
Invisibility

I thought about possibly giving them Haunt or XXX, or some kind of damaging conjuration, but this spell set is rather tight and gets the point across well. The casting frequency total is still 60/200, perhaps they could move up to 80 or 100 since once they've cast their self-enchants there's not much to do. Another direction to take them, since ancient liches are pretty tanky, would be to buff their AF_DRAIN melee.
Deep Elf Mages
These monsters are split into two:

deep elf pyromancers, who use the old fire book
deep elf zephyrmancers, who use the old air book

With 6 books, reducing to a single monster was impossible. These two books were the closest to ""iconic"", based on some player conversations they're the most memorable, the ice and earth books get lost in the mix with knights and elementalists.","<p dir=""auto"">The genesis of this branch is from a couple of different places.

<ul dir=""auto"">
<li>Cantrip</li>
<li>Magic Dart</li>
<li>Throw Flame</li>
<li>Throw Frost</li>
<li>Haste</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir=""auto"">Necromancer</h2>
<p dir=""auto"">Necromancers had two books which differed only in the choice of bolt<br>
spell. In a large fight where Bind Souls has produced many simulacra,<br>
the player could hide from either bolt by using the simulacra to block<br>
LOF. The new book gives Necromancers Bolt of Draining, which works<br>
better with their mechanic.</p>
<p dir=""auto"">New Necromancer book:</p>
<ul dir=""auto"">
<li>Bolt of Draining</li>
<li>Agony Range</li>
<li>Bind Souls</li>
<li>Invisibility</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir=""auto"">Wizard</h2>
<p dir=""auto"">Wizards' book assortment conveyed a mix of magics, to imply a mastery.<br>
Based on the D&amp;D class as far as I can tell. To keep that flavor I<br>
picked a range of spells from their books that produced the same ""mixed<br>
magic"" feel. They share depth with Ogre Magi but don't come in packs, so<br>
I went with fireball and banishment here to differentiate the two spell<br>
sets.</p>
<p dir=""auto"">New Wizard book:</p>
<ul dir=""auto"">
<li>Fireball</li>
<li>Banishment</li>
<li>Blink</li>
<li>Invisibility</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir=""auto"">Hell Knight</h2>
<p dir=""auto"">Hell Knights are one of a couple of late game monsters that cast Pain,<br>
which at their depth isn't much of a threat even when it can beat the<br>
player's Will. Bolt of Fire is good for them, they can just use that.<br>
Perhaps blink should be made non-emergency, but because Hell Knights<br>
come in packs an injured HK blinking away to let a fresh one attack the<br>
player is a nice touch.</p>
<p dir=""auto"">New Hell Knight book:</p>
<ul dir=""auto"">
<li>Bolt of Fire</li>
<li>Blink (emergency)</li>
<li>Haste</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir=""auto"">Ancient Champion</h2>
<p dir=""auto"">Another late game monster with Pain. Since they often come in bands with<br>
undead, retaining Bolt of Draining might be good but for now I went with<br>
short and sweet.</p>
<p dir=""auto"">New Ancient Champion book:</p>
<ul dir=""auto"">
<li>Iron Shot</li>
<li>Haste</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir=""auto"">Royal Mummy</h2>
<p dir=""auto"">Each of the four Royal Mummy books had Smite and Torment, the remaining<br>
mixed Summon Demon, Summon Undead, Summon Mana Viper, Summon Emperor<br>
Scorpions, and Summon Death Scarabs in some combination. Plain Summon<br>
Demon doesn't do much for RMs, Vipers are also quite fragile at the time<br>
Royal Mummies appear and vulnerable to torment, and Mummy Priests<br>
already summon undead. Scorpions are vulnerable to torment, so they're<br>
not the best here, but the flavour is good. Perhaps we could give<br>
emperor scorps rTorm. This is the old Book IV, which has the strongest<br>
Mummy flavour.</p>
<p dir=""auto"">New Royal Mummy book:</p>
<ul dir=""auto"">
<li>Smite</li>
<li>Symbol of Torment</li>
<li>Summon Emperor Scorpions</li>
<li>Summon Death Scarabs</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir=""auto"">Ogre Mage</h2>
<p dir=""auto"">Ogre Mages typically come in packs with other Ogres and are notable for<br>
hasting them. Beyond that they have a sort of wizard flavour to their<br>
book set; this consolodation picks Bolt of Magma and Parlayse to round<br>
out the set to differentiate them from Wizards which appear at<br>
overlapping depth.</p>
<p dir=""auto"">New Ogre Mage book:</p>
<ul dir=""auto"">
<li>Bolt of Magma</li>
<li>Haste Other</li>
<li>Paralyse</li>
<li>Invisibility</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir=""auto"">Tengu Conjurer</h2>
<p dir=""auto"">The different Tengu spellcasters have a hodgepodge of ""battlemage""<br>
spells. Flavour wise Tengu are supposed to be good at Conjurations and<br>
Air magic, so I settled on the air book from the four book choices.</p>
<p dir=""auto"">New Tengu Conjurer book:</p>
<ul dir=""auto"">
<li>Lightning Bolt</li>
<li>Battlesphere</li>
<li>Blink</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir=""auto"">Tengu Reaver</h2>
<p dir=""auto"">In keeping with the air theme (though less so conjurations), the new<br>
Tengu reaver book attempts to give them a pair of spells that force a<br>
player trying to melee them to reposition. The monster AI change when it<br>
comes to blocking ranged allies means that the reaver won't block its<br>
lightning spire if it can step aside, so this should interact well. It<br>
might need spell logic to prevent the reaver from summoning 10000 spires<br>
since monsters don't have summon caps, let's see how it plays.</p>
<p dir=""auto"">New Tengu Reaver book:</p>
<ul dir=""auto"">
<li>Freezing Cloud</li>
<li>Summon Lightning Spire</li>
</ul>
<h1 dir=""auto"">Liches</h1>
<p dir=""auto"">In merging spell books it was often easy to pick out the ""iconic"" spells and weave them together into a single book that still felt like the monster. For Liches, the list of ""iconic"" spells don't quite work together as a single book. Based on some of the input, I've gone with keeping Liches and Ancient lichee having the same book, a conjurations focussed book:</p>
<ul dir=""auto"">
<li>Corrosive Bolt</li>
<li>LCS</li>
<li>Haste</li>
<li>Slow</li>
<li>Invisibility</li>
</ul>
<p dir=""auto"">To complement this, since as nikheizen pointed out there's plenty of space on the L glyph, this branch introduces a new monster, draft name ""dread Lich"" (sorry I didn't go for the more ambitious names suggested). Dread Liches have the same stats as Ancient Liches, and appear in the same places (except for a couple of vaults that were using ancient liches specifically one way or another), with the spell book:</p>
<ul dir=""auto"">
<li>Haste</li>
<li>Summon Greater Demon</li>
<li>Paralyse</li>
<li>Invisibility</li>
</ul>
<p dir=""auto"">I thought about possibly giving them Haunt or XXX, or some kind of damaging conjuration, but this spell set is rather tight and gets the point across well. The casting frequency total is still 60/200, perhaps they could move up to 80 or 100 since once they've cast their self-enchants there's not much to do. Another direction to take them, since ancient liches are pretty tanky, would be to buff their AF_DRAIN melee.</p>
<h1 dir=""auto"">Deep Elf Mages</h1>
<p dir=""auto"">These monsters are split into two:</p>
<ul dir=""auto"">
<li>deep elf pyromancers, who use the old fire book</li>
<li>deep elf zephyrmancers, who use the old air book</li>
</ul>
<p dir=""auto"">With 6 books, reducing to a single monster was impossible. These two books were the closest to ""iconic"", based on some player conversations they're the most memorable, the ice and earth books get lost in the mix with knights and elementalists.</p>",2021-01-15 10:46:27,2021-01-28 18:06:05,https://github.com/crawl/crawl/pull/1689,ebering,0,

This spell is intended to give melee-focused characters more reason to

spell helps avoid it being a truly free 'gimme', and allows it to hit
many enemies at once.

by making it just a single press to cast. It also gives the player
more reason to keep normally hitting things in melee sometimes,
when it's important to kill a specific target.
UC attacks are banned to avoid this being too cheap for transmuters,

MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTkxODM1NDE0,4,Slime monster tweaks,"Add two new monster types to Slime, remove death oozes, and clean up monster distribution a little bit.
Rockslimes are trampling slimes (credit to hatsuma for this idea) made of rock, so high AC, rF++ and rElec. They're intended to be somewhere near azure jellies in threat level.
Quicksilver oozes are fast-moving slimes with AF_ENGULF and AF_ANTIMAGIC, high EV, and WILL_INVULN. They're supposed to be a bit below azure jellies in threat level.
The goal is to play with new Slime mechanics and somewhat weaken TRJ-?immo tactics while still keeping Slime as a viable third rune. If these new monsters or removal of chaff make Slime too hard, I'll dial them back a few notches.
TODOs:

Get some sprites.
More testing.

MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTgyMjIxNDc5,4,Improve Vaults monster sets,"The Vaults branch has a few long, well-known problems:

It lacks a distinct identity. The overlap between Vaults' monsters and other branches the player is likely to do shortly beforehand or after (Elven Halls, the Depths, etc) is very high.
There's too much chaff. It's good for branches to have a mix of weaker and stronger enemies, and to recontextualize enemies that were strong earlier in the game once the player has become more powerful. However, enemies like ogres, hornets, and centaurs are just extremely unlikely to pose any kind of threat to a player in Vaults.

As a result, Vault 1-4 often feel a bit of a slog, midgame doldrums. There are many things about the branch that work well - the distinctive layouts, the cool human enemies, the iconic yaktaur herds - so we should focus on them.
This branch currently makes the following changes:

Many enemies have been removed from the Vaults spawn tables, generally because they posed no threat to Vaults characters or because they overlapped with Depths, Elf, or Crypt. (I don't feel strongly about the Crypt monsters - we could certainly add some of those back in if people want.)
A few existing enemies are brought into the Vaults. Lindwurms and dire elephant bands come visiting from Lair, and peacekeepers visit from the Desolation of Salt. The former are top-tier Lair threats that pose a much lower threat in Vaults, and the latter is a standard Desolation threat that's scarier in Vaults. These enemies aren't heavily used anywhere, so it should be fun to see them in a new context.
A new human monster, the Icegrip Stalwart. Casts a Frozen Ramparts variant that does instant cold damage + flash freeze to non-allied creatures standing next to walls. (Playing with the Vaults terrain.)
A new ogre, Ironbound Thunderhulk. Fires a smitey lightning bolt that can only hit targets at least 3 cells away. (Playing with minimum range mechanics and with the big Vaults mobs that tend to clog doorways and hallways.)

TODO:

Consider whether or not we want to add more new monsters. Suggestions include ebering's Ironwhip Beastmaster and new super-orcs, Orc Hierophants and Orc Occultists.
Take another pass at the spawn tables. We should either split apart Vaults:5's spawn tables from Vaults 1:4 completely or (more likely) unify them in some way. We should double check that XP values are reasonable.

The Snake Pit has an additional issue: slow monsters. The difference between ""fast fragile swarms"" and ""slow tanky hard hitters"" does make for a nice distinction between Snake and Spider.

Damage of plain naga and naga warriors is increased
Naga Warriors gain battlecry
Nagaraja trade Teleport Other for Dimension Anchor, and drop force lance
Naga Ritualists lose force lance (and become Priests for flavour reasons)

Many overflow temples to single gods could also place as mini vaults, but the weight for each depended on the god, resulting in an uneven appearance of earlier altars for certain gods. This also prevented non-minivault overflows from placing as frequently, which is sad because they're nice vaults.
Ecumenical altars suffer from the fact that they don't always show up before identified altars; the choice becomes more about a conduct than the chance to gamble for a serious advantage.
This commit sequence addresses all three of the above issues by implementing the following changes:

All temple gods get exactly 1 guaranteed altar in the overflow range or the ecumenical temple.
The overflow range is moved to D:3-10.
There is a 33% chance of exactly 1 random altar to a temple god on D:2.
There is an 87.5% chance of an ecumenical altar on D:1-3.

There is some concern of startscumming with a D:1 ecumenical altar, but people didn't start scum for D:1 Nemelex, and a player that would quit and re-roll a D:1 ecumenical roll would probably also quit and re-roll a D:2, which we allow regularly. In this case I think the benefit of the interesting choice (roll a random god and maybe get 1* Makhleb on D:1 or maybe get xom), plus the more interesting experience for a new player (try more gods! early! even if you can't get to Temple regularly!) outweighs the start scum concern.","<p dir=""auto"">Several old overflow altars were incorrectly tagged; this gave certain gods (Ashenzari and Nemelex are stand outs) significantly higher chances of getting a D:1 altar, and don't seem intended.</p>

MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NzEyNzc3NzYy,4,Refresh and refocus the Hells,"The background of Pan dispersal sets out some of the issues with extended more broadly. This pull request is the starting point of a refresh of the Hells, aimed at removing the more repetitive aspects and making each a distinct challenge.
Overview and to-do

 Adjust hell effects to branch-wide conducts
 Shrink levels 1-6 by 75%
 Only spawn 1 stone stair on levels 1-6
 Overhaul existing vaults to ensure they're small enough to be reasonable in this regime
 Remove ""trash mobs"" from the monster lists and replace with appropriate challenges.
 Reduce over reliance on demons (other than branch-appropriate 1s) to increase distinctness from Pan.
 Review vault monster placements (both end and mid level). Wait until new monster sets settle.
 New ambush and guarded downstair vaults for levels 1-6
 More small decor vaults, the smaller levels give less opportunity for flair from the procedural generators
 Tiles for new monsters
 Fix up the vestibule population list and monster placements

Hell effects
The old hell effects existed to do three things: discourage resting, shake up tactics, and build atmosphere. In this branch Hell effects are split into two kinds, with one aiming to force tactical shifts and the other cause strategic damage to stragglers and build atmosphere.
The tactical shifts are branch-wide persistent status modifiers meant to limit player options by restricting access to different resources. Some characters will have to adapt more than others to each shift.

In Cocytus, -Potion
In Gehenna, -Scroll
In Dis, Corr(-8), if -8 is too soft this can go up to -12 or -16
In Tartarus, Will/2

Complementary to these changes, the hells now have a unified set of timed effects. These timed effects do strategic damage, making resting in the hells a poor proposition, and occasionally make a loud noise to draw monsters to a straggler. The non-noise effects are:

Contam
Drain
Stat rot

Map geometry changes
The first dive through a hell subbranch is exciting, but as the level clears out-even with spawns, until all stairs have been connected it decreases in difficulty and excitement. Smaller maps with a single stair will present the player with this initial excitement (do I juke or fight? I juked the first 5 but I got a loud hell effect on 6 and everyone can see me do I bail and risk it or spend resources to press on). The dive aspect (compared to an equivalent number of tiles spread out on a smaller number of floors) does have a different tactical feel: teleports are much less helpful on a small map and having to return to the beginning if something goes wrong and the character must bail out are two significant considerations. The dive length also gives the hells an imposing feel, the hell lords are far away, not just adjacent to the vestibule.
Implemented in branch is changes to all of the hell layouts to produce maps that are currently 75% smaller, halved in both x and y dimensions. The layout changes are parametric so further changes should be less effort (though will still require some tweaking).
In addition to shrinking the levels, the number of stairs placed is reduced to 1. The reduction in stair availability is less severe than the reduction in playable area, so the levels should still play more quickly than before. Combined, these level changes should make the non-rune-floor hell experience ""focused on the dive"", addressing some of the repetition.
Vaults review
The existing vaults have been revised for the new level generator in the following ways:

 Large vaults have become either ORIENT: centre or ORIENT: encompass
 Stair placements adjusted to the appropriate number
 Unsuitable vaults dropped from the hell rosters

Additional vaults review is needed for monster set appropriateness

 Dis vault monster placement
 Geh vault monster placement
 Tar vault monster placement
 Coc vault monster placement

New Vaults
Stair ambushes, guarded downstairs, and more small mini vaults (especially decor) are all wanted. Due to levelgen constraints the following guidelines should be followed:

keep minivaults less than 15x15; 20x20 at the largest
regular vaults should be ORIENT: centre and not much larger than 20x20
if a vault idea is quite large (getting close to 40x35) make it ORIENT: encompass
until the new monsters settle down rely on levelgen monster placement or 098.

Monster Changes
The old hell population tables are full of trash mobs. Imps! Mid-D tier monsters! Not exactly headliners for the terrifying realm of torment and woe and sin. This branch throws out the old tables and re-builds starting from the handful of iconic monsters for each hell, as well as a handful of good cross-hell monsters.
Cross-hell monsters
Tormentors and hellions (the latter with damnation flavour which is not fire flavored anymore) are in-theme for Hell, and their attacks are threatening to all characters. They create tactical tension whenever in los. As long as we don't use too many of them they have a good place in Hell.
Ancient and Dread Lichen are a high-tier threat that commands respect even from rather strong characters. In the lore they are wizards who are so powerful they escaped life and death, so we don't want to place too many in Hell. Still a few can show up, making nefarious pacts or whatever.
These cross hell monsters show up in each hell subbranch.
Finally, the Lore has Antaeus and other Colossi having some connection to the Hells. This branch strengthens this lore by adding branch specific 'C' genus monsters, either from the existing table or new ones.
Derived undead changes
Thanks for the suggestion from @nojaa3 for an initial draft. The derived undead base type list for late monsters is adjusted to move faster and hit harder. Additionally spectrals and simulacra are permitted to constrict and trample, allowing them to mess with player position.
Dis monsters

ancient champions (with skeletal warrior bands currently, this could change)
war gargoyles
iron dragons
caustic shrikes
iron giants
hell sentinels

Changed or new monsters:
Iron golem
Iron Golems are slow, and slow monsters are often sad. Dis has iron
giants, which can throw them into range, which makes them more exciting.
Except they're also not that strong, and attack slowly to boot.
To make them a better Dis monster this gives them a big buff to their AC
and HP, the idea being that they are avoidable but will block a player's
manouverability. To make their obstruction to manouvering even more
pointed, they get buffed attack and a second attack, and attack at
normal speed. The normal speed attack ensures that (depending on monster
list sequencing) they get a good chance to swing at the player after
being thrown. Big big big ruk.
Quicksilver elemental

 Quicksilver elemental tile

Both quicksilver dragons and oozes were considered, as both are flavorful for Dis.
However both
dragons and oozes are vulnerable to some of the collateral damage done
to allies by hell minions and aren't quite strong enough.
This monster is something like a cross between a quicksilver dragon and
a shard shrike, with batty movement and qs breath, though not as fast as
a shrike.
Not 100% happy with repeating the shard shrike gimmick, could drop batty from them.
Crystal echidna

 Crystal echidna tile

Meant as a ""support caster"" type monster for Dis, crystal echidnas have
barbs (to confine the player's movement while slow things catch up) and
crystal bolt (to be a bolt-bouncing threat when they're met alone in the
cramped rooms of most Dis layouts). Crystal Echidna are nonliving and
explode like green crystal for LRD.
Gehenna monsters
Existing monsters making an appearance in Geh:

hell hogs
fire giants
salamander tyrants
balrugs
hellephants
brimstone fiends

New monsters:
Creeping inferno

 Creeping inferno tile

Operating with lurking horror move rules, creeping infernos unleash a power 120 fire storm at
their location upon death. The savvy player will be able to use them to
advantage, so we won't place too many, but the player caught off guard
will be exploded.
Searing wretch

 Searing wretch tile

A hard-hitting melee threat for Gehenna, searing wretches are ghoul
genus monsters that stack on fire, sticky flame and strip fire resistance. They are complementary to the other Geh threats, which all have some sort of ranged
component, and other than hellephants are a bit flimsy at hell depth.
Stoker

 Stoker tile

Stokers are a ranged harrassment and positioning threat in Geh. The
player can defeat one solo by setting off its own creeping infernos
against it, but in a fray this back-line threat should keep the player
off balance with wind blasts and inferno-firestorms.
Tartarus monsters
Existing monsters making an appearance in Tar:

spectral derived undead
shadow wraiths
eidola
profane servitors
bone dragons
doom hounds (adjusted doom howl list)
silent spectres
tzitzimimeh

New monsters:
Putrid mouth
Putrid mouths are a new Tar monster, meant to be a more substatial (ha)
wraith genus monster to fill out the branch flavour set of threats. They
are based on Chinese mythology around hungry ghosts and re-use the old
hungry ghost tile since it was so cool. As a monster they aren't the
toughest of Tar threat, but the mix of miasma, poison, and warning cry
should combine with the small levels to prevent a player who mismanaged
the encounter from recovering before reenforcements arrive.
Tainted leviathan

 Tainted leviathan tile

A non-fiend top tier threat for Tartarus. Tainted leviathans come with
mesmerise, a miasma cloud ring to pull players into, and silence, in case the
clouds weren't enough. Oh! And they're giants so they thro rük.
Cocytus monsters
Existing monsters making an appearance:

simulacra
freezing wraiths
frost giants
titans
azure jellies
elemental wellsprings (and water elementals)
shard shrikes
ice fiends

New monsters:
Wendigo

 Wendigo tile

Wendigo are a new Cocytus monster. They're somewhat flimsy and act as
threat multipliers, with stunning burst and a new spell seracfall.
Seracfall turns a simulacrum in view into a very high power (3d43)
iceblast. Cocytus will have plenty of simulacra around as part of the
overhaul, but many simulacra are slow. The wendigo ""help"" the simulacra
along in a couple of ways. The targeting also means that a player facing
a wendigo plus simulacra will have to manage LOF from several
directions as the simulacra advance.
Nargun

 Nargun tile

Without cancellation potions, status effects are much more deadly in
Cocytus. Nargun are modelled after the Australian mythic stone
creatures, and are gargoyle-esque: they hit hard, have big AC, and a
threatening spell but weak HP. In this case they bring Petrify to the
mix, along with AF_VULN and a big HD to help it land. They are lrdable
and treated as icy.","<p dir=""auto"">The <a href=""https://github.com/crawl/crawl/wiki/Pan-Dispersal"">background of Pan dispersal</a> sets out some of the issues with extended more broadly.

<h2 dir=""auto"">Hell effects</h2>
<p dir=""auto"">The old hell effects existed to do three things: discourage resting, shake up tactics, and build atmosphere. In this branch Hell effects are split into two kinds, with one aiming to force tactical shifts and the other cause strategic damage to stragglers and build atmosphere.</p>
<p dir=""auto"">The tactical shifts are branch-wide persistent status modifiers meant to limit player options by restricting access to different resources. Some characters will have to adapt more than others to each shift.</p>
<ul dir=""auto"">
<li>In Cocytus, -Potion</li>
<li>In Gehenna, -Scroll</li>
<li>In Dis, Corr(-8), if -8 is too soft this can go up to -12 or -16</li>
<li>In Tartarus, Will/2</li>
</ul>
<p dir=""auto"">Complementary to these changes, the hells now have a unified set of timed effects. These timed effects do strategic damage, making resting in the hells a poor proposition, and occasionally make a loud noise to draw monsters to a straggler. The non-noise effects are:</p>
<ul dir=""auto"">
<li>Contam</li>
<li>Drain</li>
<li>Stat rot</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir=""auto"">Map geometry changes</h2>
<p dir=""auto"">The first dive through a hell subbranch is exciting, but as the level clears out-even with spawns, until all stairs have been connected it decreases in difficulty and excitement. Smaller maps with a single stair will present the player with this initial excitement (do I juke or fight? I juked the first 5 but I got a loud hell effect on 6 and everyone can see me do I bail and risk it or spend resources to press on). The dive aspect (compared to an equivalent number of tiles spread out on a smaller number of floors) does have a different tactical feel: teleports are much less helpful on a small map and having to return to the beginning if something goes wrong and the character must bail out are two significant considerations. The dive length also gives the hells an imposing feel, the hell lords are far away, not just adjacent to the vestibule.</p>
<p dir=""auto"">Implemented in branch is changes to all of the hell layouts to produce maps that are currently 75% smaller, halved in both x and y dimensions. The layout changes are parametric so further changes should be less effort (though will still require some tweaking).</p>
<p dir=""auto"">In addition to shrinking the levels, the number of stairs placed is reduced to 1. The reduction in stair availability is less severe than the reduction in playable area, so the levels should still play more quickly than before. Combined, these level changes should make the non-rune-floor hell experience ""focused on the dive"", addressing some of the repetition.</p>
<h3 dir=""auto"">Vaults review</h3>
<p dir=""auto"">The existing vaults have been revised for the new level generator in the following ways:</p>
<ul class=""contains-task-list"">
<li class=""task-list-item""><input type=""checkbox"" id="""" disabled="""" class=""task-list-item-checkbox"" aria-label=""Completed task"" checked=""""> Large vaults have become either <code class=""notranslate"">ORIENT: centre</code> or <code class=""notranslate"">ORIENT: encompass</code></li>

</ul>
<h3 dir=""auto"">New Vaults</h3>
<p dir=""auto"">Stair ambushes, guarded downstairs, and more small mini vaults (especially decor) are all wanted. Due to levelgen constraints the following guidelines should be followed:</p>
<ul dir=""auto"">
<li>keep minivaults less than 15x15; 20x20 at the largest</li>
<li>regular vaults should be <code class=""notranslate"">ORIENT: centre</code> and not much larger than 20x20</li>
<li>if a vault idea is quite large (getting close to 40x35) make it <code class=""notranslate"">ORIENT: encompass</code></li>
<li>until the new monsters settle down rely on levelgen monster placement or 098.</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir=""auto"">Monster Changes</h2>
<p dir=""auto"">The old hell population tables are full of trash mobs. Imps! Mid-D tier monsters! Not exactly headliners for the terrifying realm of torment and woe and sin. This branch throws out the old tables and re-builds starting from the handful of iconic monsters for each hell, as well as a handful of good cross-hell monsters.</p>
<h3 dir=""auto"">Cross-hell monsters</h3>
<p dir=""auto"">Tormentors and hellions (the latter with damnation flavour which is not fire flavored anymore) are in-theme for Hell, and their attacks are threatening to all characters. They create tactical tension whenever in los. As long as we don't use too many of them they have a good place in Hell.</p>
<p dir=""auto"">Ancient and Dread Lichen are a high-tier threat that commands respect even from rather strong characters. In the lore they are wizards who are so powerful they escaped life and death, so we don't want to place too many in Hell. Still a few can show up, making nefarious pacts or whatever.</p>
<p dir=""auto"">These cross hell monsters show up in each hell subbranch.</p>
<p dir=""auto"">Finally, the Lore has Antaeus and other Colossi having some connection to the Hells. This branch strengthens this lore by adding branch specific 'C' genus monsters, either from the existing table or new ones.</p>
<h3 dir=""auto"">Derived undead changes</h3>
<p dir=""auto"">Thanks for the suggestion from <a class=""user-mention notranslate"" data-hovercard-type=""user"" data-hovercard-url=""/users/nojaa3/hovercard"" data-octo-click=""hovercard-link-click"" data-octo-dimensions=""link_type:self"" href=""https://github.com/nojaa3"">@nojaa3</a> for an initial draft. The derived undead base type list for late monsters is adjusted to move faster and hit harder.

PR_kwDOAV-Jfs4vVfHR,4,Rekindle the Black Torch,"This is an implementation along the lines of the design sketch for a new Yred included in the 0.28 plan.
The executive summary:

At 0* Yred grants passive reaping of living and demonic creatures, as well as recall. Things with a corpse come up as zombies, things without as spectrals (including those poor souls whose corpse was exploded). These reaped creatures stick around until the player leaves the level.
Yred Piety is proportional to the number of Yred servants in the player's los.
At 2* Yred grants the ""Dark Bargain"" active, which trades some zombies/specters for a long-duration Yred servant summon. Summon quality scales with piety, and the summon list now covers all (non-harmful) n, z, V, and W monsters (except Vampire magi who are kiku nerds).
At 4* Yred grants ""Drain Life"". Same as old drain life, but now costs zombies/specters as well as mp.
At 5* Yred grants ""Enslave Soul"". Same as old enslaved soul. This is the only interlevel-recallable ally in new Yred.

The design goals of this redesign are:

Preserve the identity of Yred (zombie momentum plays, reap and harvest the living, bone dragon pals).
Minimize reliance on interlevel recall.
Reduce the total number of permanent allies drastically.
Experiment with alternative piety systems.

The new model assigns the equipment first, based entirely on species apts, then assigns stats and skills afterward depending on what we got.

PR_kwDOAV-Jfs4zMhti,4,Discourage pillar dancing and improve starting kits,"Especially early on, players can find themselves in a situation where they're right next to an enemy and will probably die if they fight that enemy. (A hobgoblin, a yak, what have you.) If the player has no consumables available, or isn't in much risk of dying from one hit, the best plan is often to run around in circles until the monster either (a) gets in one hit (and thus loses enough energy to create a 1-space gap) or (b) loses a turn from random energy, and then to flee up stairs, close a door, etc. Or just to run around until the player has regenerated to full hp/mp and restart the fight!
(Random energy was intended to discourage this, but doesn't succeed.)
This is fiddly and unfun. It's not good gameplay. Removing random energy solves (b), but in many ways it just makes the situation worse - without the ability to create a gap, players are forced to continue ""pillar-dancing"" until they fully regenerate.
So, in addition to removing random energy, this PR adds a new 'parting attack' mechanic for monsters. Whenever the player moves away from a foe, that foe has a 1/5 chance of launching an attack. This means that running around while next to a threatening enemy is unlikely to be net positive over time. (If you have at least one space between you and your foe, you can still pillar dance to your heart's content, but that's no worse than it was before. And you should usually be able to get to stairs or something in those cases.)
This does make tactical repositioning slightly harder, but only slightly. If you're next to a gnoll and want to move across all of LOS to get into a corridor before the gnoll's pals enter melee, you'll be attacked about once en route (on average), which is still better than spending 2 or more turns in melee with multiple enemies.
To compensate, and to add more early-game options and decision-making in general, this PR adds a variety of new items to different backgrounds. The goal is to give players buttons they can use to deal with one or two rough fights, without overcompensating and trivializing the early game or neutering the ID game. The current list of changes:

All 'mages' ('pure casters') start with a potion of magic.
Fighters get an additional potion of might.
Gladiators get a few throwing weapons, roughly half of what the AM
throwing start got.
Monks get two potions of ambrosia. (See, it's divine.)
Hunters get a throwing net. (Not sure about this one.)
Brigands get an additional poisoned & curare dart.
Artificers trade their xom piece for nine charges of iceblast.
Wanderers get an additional random potion or scroll.
Delvers get nothing, for now, since I'm already pretty happy with
how they play. They're a challenge anyway, really. :)
Berserkers and Cinder Acolytes likewise get nothing. They already
have perfectly good early game buttons.
Abyssal Knights start at 60 piety (just over 2*) instead of 38 (just
over 1*). This should allow them to use Bend Space if needed.
(I think they're still quite weak.)
Chaos Knights get Artificer's xom chesspiece.
Transmuters get a potion of lignification, which should work well
with their unarmed combat focus. It's also very thematic.
Warpers get a few more boomerangs of dispersal.
Arcane Markspersons get a few boomerangs of dispersal too. I'm sort
of hoping to rework this background more broadly at some point.
Enchanters get another potion of invisibility.

All of these are subject to change.
Other things tried in earlier versions of this PR:

""Closing attack"": monsters have a 1/6 chance of attacking when moving adjacent to you. Felt too intrusive into 'normal combat'.
""Following attack"": monsters have a chance of attacking when moving into a space that you just left. Encouraged zig-zagging while retreating.

Other things that have been discussed, but not implemented:

Tighten time pressure? (Difficult with DCSS's map generation, which has a lot of big empty spaces.)

Motivation: corpses-as-items have tended to be problematic.

-Merge pain and animate skeleton into a rift wizard style ""death bolt"" (needs a different name under crawl naming conventions) that animates monsters it kills
-Rework corpse rot as a higher level necro/poison duration spell
-Turn animate dead into a death channel style effect
-Turn simulacrum into a single target irresistible status (somewhat like infest) that spawns a power-dependent number of simulacra when the monster dies
-Overhaul everything Kiku does except book gifts.

PR_kwDOAV-Jfs47JPm_,4,Changes to god wrath,"Slow fuzzing (Chei, Trog, do_more failthrough):
The slow_player() function already implements checks to limit the maximum duration of slow, and they occur downstream of the checks in god-wrath.cc -- The checks in god-wrath can pass if DUR_SLOW is between 100 * BASELINE_DELAY and 180 * BASELINE_DELAY, but the checks in slow_player will fail and the player won't actually get slowed. I'm removing the checks in god-wrath.cc.
In addition, every other god wrath duration effect has a random component to its duration, except the slow effects. I'm making it 91+random2(10), it keeps the average but increases the spread.
Makhleb greater servants:
The code comment suggests that having 6 servants at XL27 should be possible, the current code maxes out as 4. This fixes it, but at the cost of giving every XL the possibility of more greater servants. I think this is fine, god wrath should be punishing, and there's not a chance of penance (because Makhleb does not have a conduct), but I understand if folks disagree.
Slime XL scaling:
Jiyva's slime summon retribution is just as likely to summon a jelly as an acid blob at every XL. This is silly -- A jelly is not a threat after XL7 or so, and we have more interesting trivial monsters for high-level players (slime creatures), so I figure it's probably okay to just remove jelly from that list.
Lugonu minor minion fuzzing:
Lugonu's wrath has a major case and a minor case, if it rolls major the number of lesser servants is random and there's a guaranteed major (and maybe a bonus major). If it rolls minor, the number of lesser servants is not random. I've replaced the flat 1 + XL/7 with random2(3) + XL/7, this gives a 1/3 chance that a low-XL minor roll will return no monsters which stinks, so I've special-cased it: you're guaranteed one.
Zin: Oops All Badmuts
Zin's wrath has a 33% chance to do literally nothing if you have mutations but all of them are bad. This is silly: Zin hates chaos, so you should absolutely not be rewarded for being chaotic in wrath. Rather, it should recite at you if you're so chaotic you're beyond saving. So, I've made it do that.

PR_kwDOAV-Jfs4tMWw8,4,Standardize Linux packages,"Modern Linux distributions and other OSs following the XDG specifications, require some files to integrate programs into desktop menus and software centers. We provide some of these files in the Debian packages (which are uncomplete and outdated), but they cannot be easily reused by other distributions. This leads to every distribution providing their own versions of the files, all of them different. PR #464 tries to address this problem, but it doesn't allow executable name customization via GAME variable (introduced later), it doesn't improve the Debian packages and adds more redundant files to the repository. To make things even worse, I proposed the inclusion of yet another version of these files in #2049.
I made some changes in #464, trying to be flexible enough for every distribution and updated the Debian packages. The AppImage support only requires a few more lines in the Makefile. The name of the files is governed by the GAME variable, so several builds of the game (usually console and tiles) can coexist indepently and without conflicts.
Example:
make -j4 prefix=/usr DESTDIR=/package/dir TILES=y GAME=crawl-tiles install install-xdg-data
Detail of changes:


New build target: install-xdg-data. Installs some files required by Linux packages according to the XDG specifications (freedesktop.org).

New build target: appimage. Builds a Linux AppImage with the help of the install-xdg-data target and the linuxdeploy tool.

Closes #464
Closes #1256
Closes #2049","<p dir=""auto"">Modern Linux distributions and other OSs following the XDG specifications, require some files to integrate programs into desktop menus and software centers. We provide some of these files in the Debian packages (which are uncomplete and outdated), but they cannot be easily reused by other distributions. This leads to every distribution providing their own versions of the files, all of them different. PR <a class=""issue-link js-issue-link"" data-error-text=""Failed to load title"" data-id=""208725361"" data-permission-text=""Title is private"" data-url=""https://github.com/crawl/crawl/issues/464"" data-hovercard-type=""pull_request"" data-hovercard-url=""/crawl/crawl/pull/464/hovercard"" href=""https://github.com/crawl/crawl/pull/464"">#464</a> tries to address this problem, but it doesn't allow executable name customization via GAME variable (introduced later), it doesn't improve the Debian packages and adds more redundant files to the repository. To make things even worse, I proposed the inclusion of yet another version of these files in <a class=""issue-link js-issue-link"" data-error-text=""Failed to load title"" data-id=""957238470"" data-permission-text=""Title is private"" data-url=""https://github.com/crawl/crawl/issues/2049"" data-hovercard-type=""pull_request"" data-hovercard-url=""/crawl/crawl/pull/2049/hovercard"" href=""https://github.com/crawl/crawl/pull/2049"">#2049</a>.</p>
<p dir=""auto"">I made some changes in <a class=""issue-link js-issue-link"" data-error-text=""Failed to load title"" data-id=""208725361"" data-permission-text=""Title is private"" data-url=""https://github.com/crawl/crawl/issues/464"" data-hovercard-type=""pull_request"" data-hovercard-url=""/crawl/crawl/pull/464/hovercard"" href=""https://github.com/crawl/crawl/pull/464"">#464</a>, trying to be flexible enough for every distribution and updated the Debian packages. The AppImage support only requires a few more lines in the Makefile. The name of the files is governed by the GAME variable, so several builds of the game (usually console and tiles) can coexist indepently and without conflicts.</p>

PR_kwDOAV-Jfs48QKa-,4,fix: correct webtiles hidpi implementation,"This commit reverts 3925e26. (And could use some eyes because of this.)
To get hidpi to work in a browser canvas object, the internal dimensions
need to be twice that of the external dimensions (essentially). The
normal way of implementing this is to multiply the internal dimensions
by devicePixelRatio, and scale the canvas accordingly. We used to do
this, but 3925e26 changed things so that the external dimensions
were halved. This was, according to the commit message, in order to
prevent scaling artifacts on firefox. (Where the salient fact is that
window.devicePixelRatio on some browsers, these days including
chrome/firefox but not safari, also changes with browser zoom.) However,
a consequence is that tile rendering is halved on hidpi devices, exactly
not what should happen. This change also made for a lot of messy code
that had to interact directly with devicePixelRatio.
The half-size tile rendering wasn't immediately noticeable because the
dungeon is auto-scaled, and the monster list matches its scale to the
dungeon. But, icons in menus and popups instantiate the problem, and
scaling them to the dungeon size is not ideal. The action panel also had
some workarounds for this that I didn't fully understand at the time. (I
only noticed this myself after many years of working on this stuff
because I switched from a regular-density monitor to a 4k monitor of
similar size, even though I've used retina devices for a long time.
Hidpi devices have been broken for so long that I won't be surprised if
we get requests to readd this behavior as an option or something, menus
may look odd now to people who have only ever played on hidpi.)
In my testing so far, I can't really detect any rendering differences
between the approach after this commit and the approach in
3925e26. However, I'm not exactly sure of what the original
issues were, and this commit should be tested on a non-hidpi device
before merge.","<p dir=""auto"">This commit reverts <a class=""commit-link"" data-hovercard-type=""commit"" data-hovercard-url=""https://github.com/crawl/crawl/commit/3925e268bea408accdad6c7c53f37f2d36b3116a/hovercard"" href=""https://github.com/crawl/crawl/commit/3925e268bea408accdad6c7c53f37f2d36b3116a""><tt>3925e26</tt></a>.

A launcher for the Android port supporting new features.

Keyboard selector.

Classic keyboard, same as before.
Transparent keyboard, classic with no background drawn on top of the game.

Optional extra mini keyboard with directional keys that can be placed on a corner.
Configure the keyboard size, well, height only because we're using all the width available already.

Improved support for old devices
In theory, DCSS was playable on any device supported by SDL2, that's every version from Android 4.1. However, I tested it using virtual devices and it crashes. This release fixes those crashes and uses the AppCompat library and themes for proper rendering on any supported version.
There are other minor changes, please see the commit descriptions for details.

PR_kwDOAV-Jfs5OL53l,4,Add some new Slime Pit endings,"slime_pit: The main change was splitting out the various functions for making the clear walls disappear when TRJ dies. I also removed some downstairs glyphs, which were in there for some reason. I removed the ""no_dump"" tag, since now that there are variants, players might want to see which one they got. I also trimmed some excess walls off the edges to get the width less than 70 tiles, allowing the vault to be rotated, and accordingly removed the ""no_rotate"" tag.
slime_pit_nicolae_amoeboid: A variation on the basic slime_pit theme -- stairs near the outer edge of slime walls, with stone, loot, and TRJ in the center. The slime walls and loot boxes are of course shaped differently, and the corridors in between them here aren't as narrow as in slime_pit original recipe.
slime_pit_nicolae_biohazard: A concept of 3-towards-1, in which there are three distinct paths to the center, and going from one upstair to another requires going through the TRJ zone. This specific layout is inspired by the negative space in the biohazard symbol; hence the name.
slime_pit_nicolae_inversion: Switching it around a little: stairs near an outer edge of stone walls, with loot and other decorative bits around the outer edge. The center holds slime walls and TRJ. As the comment notes, there is usually an acidless path to the center, but it's not guaranteed. But standing near an acid wall doesn't have long-term effects anymore, so it'll be fine. Probably. The distance between the loot vaults will no doubt make it harder for Jiyvites to get the good stuff before it gets munched. I do not consider this a problem.
slime_pit_nicolae_jellycorners: A smaller version of slime_pit_nicolae_rhizomes. Both layouts are built around the same idea: instead of starting near the edge and working one's way inwards, you start at the center and work your way outwards. Here, TRJ is lurking in one of the square stone ruins in the corners. The decaying stone walls might end up providing a little niche to hide in, but also maybe not.
slime_pit_nicolae_rhizomes: Made before slime_pit_nicolae_jellycorners, on the same basic concept. At first I thought it might be too large to work, since the player has to hunt all around the edge for TRJ, but reconsidered and thought it might be fine. We'll see.
slime_pit_nicolae_royal_road_to_ruin: For a bit, I considered a layout that was mostly just an A-to-B path, rather than mostly open areas the player can wander through; this concept was rejected and the map I'd made was turned into nicolae_slime_spelunking. The loot/TRJ section from that was kept and reused here. Here, the three stairs start in a mostly-open area, and then converge on the center together, turning into a short A-to-B path. Like slime_pit_nicolae_jellycorners, players will walk through decaying ruins of the pre-Slime civilization, which may or may not provide fightin' niches.
slime_pit_nicolae_trefoil: Another variation of the 3-towards-1 theme from slime_pit_nicolae_biohazard. Here, there's quite a bit more loot, so there are more monsters to compensate, and not many good places to hole up.
For all the new vaults, I mostly kept the same amount and ratios of monsters (types, numbers) and loot (* relative to |) as in slime_pit. That stuff is a pain to balance, and I figured it'd be easiest to go with what I know. I also didn't bother weighting any of the vaults; that can come later with feedback.","<p dir=""auto"">slime_pit: The main change was splitting out the various functions for making the clear walls disappear when TRJ dies.

PR_kwDOAV-Jfs5Ws9Hi,4,feat: unusual monster item threat highlighting,"This commit adds a new game option: unusual_monster_items.
When set, this option highlights monsters carrying 'unusual' items, similar to the existing tiles highlighting for 'nasty' monsters.
This is a list option that matches regexes against each monster's inventory, so players can customize this in a very granular way. You could, for example, highlight any monster carrying snakebite.
This works in both tiles and console through a pair of associated options, tile_show_threat_levels = unusual , and unusual_highlight = hi:magenta . Please see options_guide.txt for details.

PR_kwDOAV-Jfs5X1Ipw,4,Updated tileidx_feature to prevent override of DNGN_UNKNOWN_PORTAL,"In depth write-up of the cause of #3225:
Gauntlet portal would be leaked by magic mapping via a scroll of magic mapping/revelations and then examining shop/portal tiles. The bug can be reproduced by setting PLACE: D:2 on the gauntlet entrance vault, and then descending to the second level of the dungeon. Simply placing the gauntlet entrance tile in wizard mode, and then clearing map knowledge does not repro the bug; the custom lua script in gauntlet.des is what causes the leak.
gauntlet.des uses the dgn.til lua function, which leads to tile_env.flv(pos).feat being set when laying out the gauntlet entrance vault in a level. tile_env.flv(pos).feat can override env.map_knowledge(pos) in tileidx_feature, which is used by the describe popup to select the appropriate tile.
This commit prevents the leak by adding DNGN_UNKNOWN_PORTAL as a tile exempt from being overriden. Removing the dng.tile call on the lua side seems to work as well, but I'm unsure which side effects that could have. Additionally, it makes sense to generally prevent DNGN_UNKNOWN_PORTAL from being overridden.

PR_kwDOAV-Jfs5n-70F,4,Check for flight item removal safety on swap,"When removing an item, _safe_to_remove_or_wear checked for the safety of removing the item if it provided flight and the player was above lava or deep water. However when swapping two items, remove is false and the removal of the old item is implicit. The function to check the safety of flight removal safe_to_remove is not called in this case.
This commit adds a flight removal safety check in the branch of _safe_to_remove_or_wear that has determined that we're swapping out an old item, echoing the check that was already happening for non-swap removal.
I added comments to both safe_to_remove checks, because it is not immediately clear that only flight removal safety is checked by that function. _safe_to_remove_or_wear has a comment stating that it checks for stat zero and does not mention flight, so I wanted to make sure the code doing something other than what that comment says was clearly signaled.
Resolves #3502
Notes:

This is a two-line fix, and I think it's fairly clean, considering the surrounding code.
This needs to get merged to 0.31 as well.
One issue remains: trying to swap an item that gives flight for another item that gives flight is not possible. I think that's a less frustrating edge case than surprise emergency flight, so I wanted to PR this with the quick, simple fix first. It also kind of makes sense if momentarily taking off your ring of flight for another ring of flight would be dangerous, so I'm not sure if this is a feature or a bug.
This code is pretty confusing. I think it might be fun to clean things up and rework/refactor how these checks are implemented. I can't commit to that, but I'd like to mess around and see how far I can get. Would it be something the devs were open to? (I wouldn't want to refactor something that's getting heavy work right now with the all the Coglin equipment stuff?)

The second bug caused netting a target that's standing on top of a net to merge the nets together, breaking both nets once the target breaks free.
Now the cottage is on fire and both bugs are dead. Throwing nets that hit a netted target will not net the target and nets that successfully net a target will not merge with any nets on the floor.
There is a third bug that causes a net that drops from killing a netted monster to not merge with any nets on the ground, but that one is harmless enough so I let it go. Hopefully it won't come back to take revenge for its friends' deaths.

PR_kwDOAV-Jfs5yoPUg,4,Set monster gods in YAML.,"_place_monster_set_god() is now place_monster_maybe_override_god(). It can override the YAML-set god (orc Beogh-worshippers and unbelievers, Xom-adopted holies in the Abyss), and gives any priestly monsters with no god set the nameless god, just like the old code, except without the explicit genus checks. The explicit genus checks were redundant anyway, since they all fell through to the default case.
The old code included a comment that all (non-priestly) angels and daevas worship TSO, except for Mennas. However, the actual code made all (non-priestly) holies worship TSO except for Mennas and apises (Elyvilon worshippers); seraphim were explicitly set as TSO worshippers. I've made the new code give angels and daevas who normally worship TSO a chance to worship Xom in the Abyss; doing that for all holy beings who worship TSO would override seraphim.
Also, make orc apostles explicitly worship Beogh, instead of leaving it as a 6-out-of-7 chance for the non-priestly ones. It doesn't make sense for the latter to be unbelievers.","<p dir=""auto"">_place_monster_set_god() is now place_monster_maybe_override_god().

I agree a full screen option for Android can improve the user
experience. Mostly when playing on landscape mode with modern devices.
You can read this in the docs:

Where you set the UI flags makes a difference. If you hide the system
bars in your activity's onCreate() method and the user presses Home,
the system bars will reappear. When the user reopens the activity,
onCreate() won't get called, so the system bars will remain visible.
If you want system UI changes to persist as the user navigates in and
out of your activity, set UI flags in onResume() or
onWindowFocusChanged().

Tried both options and the behaviour when using onWindowsFocusChanged
is more consistent. When using onResume, full screen is lost whenever

Draconian wings would remain on player dolls until saving and reloading if they had lost their big wings mutation. This change has the loss of the big wing mutation initialize the player doll so we properly lose the wings when this occurs.
Reported by kuniqsX and resolves #3973
Changes

Added init_player_doll(); with a USE_TILE def compiler flag under the MUT_BIG_WINGS switch case for the following code:

crawl-ref/source/mutation.cc

static bool _delete_single_mutation_level(mutation_type mutat, ...





Investigation
Tested with the committed code change alongside the NOT committed code changes to potion.cc for easy reproduction:
    bool effect(bool = true, int = 40, bool = true) const override
    {
        if (have_passive(passive_t::cleanse_mut_potions))
            simple_god_message("" cleanses your potion of mutation!"");
        else
            mpr(""You feel extremely strange."");
        bool mutated = false;

        static bool true_to_add = true;

        // Remove mutations.
        if (!true_to_add)
        {
            mprf(MSGCH_DIAGNOSTICS, ""Removing MUT_BIG_WINGS"");
            mutated |= delete_mutation(MUT_BIG_WINGS, ""potion of mutation"", false);
        }
        // Add mutations.

PR_kwDOAV-Jfs6HRyEs,4,Remove GLU dependency,"Avoid depending on deprecated GLU library by dynamically loading
OpenGL 3+ function glGenerateMipmap where available.
If it's not available, Where it's not, we just render without mipmapping.
Note that for a lot of resolution / rc setting / zoom level combos,
we don't mipmap anyway, and this PR doesn't change those cases at all.
Also note that OpenGL 3.0 was released in 2008.
glGenerateMipmap is available even on decade old GPUs and iGPUs as a result.
For players running truly ancient GPUs and systems that supported GLU,
but not OpenGL 3, and who happened to have just the right setup for us to
enable mipmapping, we will now render without it.
If anyone actually does turn out to be affected, they may be able to use
a version of llvmpipe that supports OpenGL 3+ as a software renderer.
llvmpipe is available on Linux and Unix-like systems.
Also note we could turn on mipmapping on GLES targets according to
https://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL-Refpages/es3.0/html/glGenerateMipmap.xhtml.
This may be quite useful for low resolution screens, like older android phones.
But I'll leave that for a future commit.","<p dir=""auto"">Avoid depending on deprecated GLU library by dynamically loading<br>

Background
After discussion a few items where suggested in #1422 as improvements:

During standard interactions, place the terminal cursor at the new-turn underscore instead of at the player, so that ""start reading from cursor"" reads the message window.
During targeting mode, place the terminal cursor at the description portion of the message window, so that ""start reading from cursor"" reads what's currently being targeted (and add an option to display the player relative coordinates).
For other things that use the message window for a prompt move the cursor appropriately to the start of the prompt.
When displaying full screen menus, move the cursor to the top left
When full screen menus give a prompt (like in acquirement) move the cursor to the start of the prompt.

Most of the suggested changes already have been merged into crawl (except the additional positions when aiming). The cursor positioning is made unnecessary by placing the message window at the top of the terminal, and by clearing old messages (see also ""Options for blind players"" from the options_guide).","<h3 dir=""auto"">Main Changes</h3>

Fix coglins not receiving unwield prompts when switching between weapons
Fix delay interrupts (most notably abyss entry from coglin distortion unwield) from asking the player twice whether they would like to ""Keep equipping themselves?""

Another thing that arose during the making of this PR: when being banished or shafted, you.time_taken is set to 3/4 of the usual time it would take for the player to complete their action, which can have bizarre effects.

PR_kwDOAV-Jfs6qAOfD,4,Fix merfolk fish-tail clipping in Quill form,"Quill form is not a full-body polymorph like Dragon or Fortress Crab; it only alters certain body parts, similar to Hive or Maw. Therefore the tile should preserve the player's original species silhouette.
Genies and nagas already have bespoke lower-body tiles for this purpose, but merfolk were left wearing a humanoid ""legs"" layer on top of their fish tail. Copy the approach used for Hive: when a merfolk is in water (fishtail active) simply crop the bottom of the Quill armour tile so the tail remains the only visible lower extremity. This produces a clean, species-consistent sprite.

PR_kwDOAV-Jfs6tWIW6,4,feat: Adjust Body Armour acquirement,"Currently body armour acqurement is dominated by robes, ring mails,
troll leather, plate and crystal plate. Higher armour skill makes plate
and crystal plate more likely, but the chance to get one of those five
is about the same even at 27 skill.
Additionally scale mail and chain mail are very rare. This version
brings several new body armour egos that spawn on scale, chain or plate
so it makes sense to make those slightly more likely.
Okawaru gifts also tend to leave a bad feeling after being offered a
robe or troll leather on your heavy armour using char.
This commit changes the weights of ring, scale, chain, plate and cpa.
It also changes the formula for body armour acquirement so low base AC
body armours become significantly less likely at higher armour skill.
For example: Body size restricted species still had ~27% to acquire
robes or TLA at 27 Armour skill. With the new formula at 27 skill
that chance is ~2.5%. For normal size species robe + tla + ring
mail went from ~23% at 27 with the old formula to ~4% with the new
