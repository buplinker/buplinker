Possibly the writeback is causing a penalty maybe.. It's really hard to get anything useful performance wise on Android it seems like. Everything varies so much by run, and my FPS dances up and down and is never stable (I have power saving on so I can get < 100% speed and not deal with the impact of frameskip.) But it seems like this is averaging faster per profile and fps. Note: VLDM was already a NEON instr, this just makes it aligned. -[Unknown]",https://github.com/hrydgard/ppsspp/pull/5696,unknownbrackets,0

Especially all those windows project changes were done with a text editor and someone needs to ensure that the platform dir is hooked up properly and the main dir is gone from the project. I also payed some attention to not break unit tests. Will do a manual jenkins run for this once the platform devs ack'ed the general approach. Basically its a ""simple"" filesystem reshuffle.",https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/pull/8532,Memphiz,0

First is an improvement of when albumartistonly flag is present in the musicURL letting it override the default setting. This means that regardless of the global setting that is being applied to the default nodes, the user can create custom nodes that show either all artists or just the album artists (in combination with other criteria). The second is a mistake when the node/playlist rule is limiting an ""artists"" type of list to a genre. The query needs to look at both album_artist/album_genre tables as well as song_artist/song_genre, in the same way that the default nodes do. I tripped over this here http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=235785, now I have the knowledge to fix it. Say I have songs with ""Classical"" genre and ""Tchaikovsky"" in the ALBUMARTIST tag but not ARTIST. before this fix Tchaikovsky would incorrectly appear in a list of artists that has rule ""isnot"" ""Classical"", but fail to be listed in one that has rule ""is"" ""Classical"" - all up the wrong way!

Code changes are in two commits. The first one implements a (hopefully) platform independent ColorManager class. If lcms2 is not available, only 3DLUT file format is supported. The second commit adds the necessary bits to the Linux OpenGL renderer, building on the previously added output stage. The ICC profile linking is still work in progress, but I included it as it is functional and shows what can be done with it. It will also be needed if/when color management is implemented for the photo viewer. The 3DLUT files provide the best accuracy (at the cost of runtime flexibility) - ArgyllCMS is very smart and the linker here is quite simple. Slight adjustments may be needed for #9720 - I'll update if/when that is merged to master. One significant improvement I would like help with: it would be nice to keep the 3D lookup texture around as it takes a while to upload. It is most noticeable when running many short video clips back to back. @FernetMenta, any thoughts? I'm still pretty new to the Kodi codebase. Any feedback is welcome. Pinging @Memphiz and @popcornmix since my previous work broke gles - would you mind checking this out? Are there any gles platforms that could be supported, or better to just disable this and make sure not to break anything?",https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/pull/9731,laurimyllari,0

The only exception here are our internal (special/pvr/addon) paths which only have a fixed non-overlapping set of parent paths, for those comparisons we can safely use StartsWith().

All came up during testing to make the songs node as efficient as possible (within the limits of the current CFileItem list overall design), see #11785 The way embedded cuesheet handling was implemented for v15, using the music db, was taking 7% of the total time taken to process the songs node, even if there were no cuesheets in the music collection. This was all in order get replay gain for embedded cuesheets, that were then only applied in certain playback paths, and as a minority use clearly not worth the overhead. Disabled as a quick work around in v17, this PR redesigns how replay gain for both kinds of cuesheet songs is implemented. There appeared to be two possible approaches to applying the replay gain values for cuesheet songs in the library: The latter seems the best way to avoid additional repeated processing of cue documents during playback, so the schema change stores any replaygain values in the song table. This avoids LEFT joins (which are slow on SQLite and worth avoiding), but most importantly it avoids the original separate query per song approach that is so inefficient on larger music collections. As 4 float values (8 byte each), never used in music slection or filtering, it is most space efficient to store the album and track gain and peak values as a single string.",https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/pull/12082,DaveTBlake,0

This was inspired by @phil65 ""Media sources"" item in Estuary, so this add similar ability to core in order to be available to everyone and not just Estuary users. These changes would allow removal of ""Media sources"" from Estuary as this function could now be handled by core, however didn't want to be presumptuous about doing that myself, so will leave that decision to the skinners. I've marked this as [WIP] since I've renamed the Library section to Media, however to be done in a 100% proper manner the underlying window would also need to be renamed, for example: https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/blob/master/xbmc/guilib/WindowIDs.h#L46 WINDOW_SETTINGS_LIBRARY to WINDOW_SETTINGS_MEDIA However this would break skins already updated to use the ActivateWindow(LibrarySettings) call in their skin Settings.xml, so would require changing to ActivateWindow(MediaSettings) if the window was renamed. Thus at the moment I've played it safe and only included the labelling changes and I've NOT yet renamed the underlying window name in code to avoid breaking skins.

During testing, we uncovered a bug specific to your application running on the Android O Developer Preview. Here are the details: Step(s) to Reproduce: Expected Result(s): Observed Result(s): Possible Root Cause(s): calling this method: icon.getBitmap(). This used to work in N and below because all Icons were png, in which they could be cast to BitmapDrawable. However, starting in the next OS, there is no guarantee icon drawable objects can automatically convert to BitmapDrawable. There is also no guarantee that all of BitmapDrawable's methods (such as getBitmap) will be readily available.

Requests for implementation date back to 2013 (e.g. https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=178478). Background is provided via an opaque texture drawn below the rendered glyphs. This is only enabled if the opacity of the background is not set to 0% otherwise behaviour stays exactly the same as before. [Motivation and Context] Some media files have embed subtitles in the video stream - having subtitles with an opaque background makes the watching experience more pleasant. Furthermore a few users reported that even with the outline border in the subtitle font sometimes they can't read the subtitles correctly when the background is too bright.

Currently, the game OSD help dialog (added in #14425) is shown once on first gameplay, then hidden. However, it presents a very important message - controllers are required to play games. Users will ignore this. Over and over again. That's why we keep showing the help dialog as long as they keep trying to launch games without a controller connected. Noteworthy about this change is the beginning of my ""agent"" abstraction. Because the term ""player"" is overloaded (player core and human player), I'm basing the abstractions for my player manager on the word ""agent"". ""Agent"" is the game-theoretic term for game players, notably used by reinforcement learning algorithms. I wonder where this is going...
