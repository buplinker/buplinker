Link a User Review (UR) to a Pull Request (PR) if:
- UR discusses the same feature, component, or issue fixed by the PR.
- UR reports performance, stability, or crash issues possibly affected by the PR's change.

Exclude if:
- PR only changes build systems, dependencies, CI/CD, code style, refactors, formatting, documentation, tests, or internal tooling without user-facing impact.
- UR gives general praise or vague complaints clearly unrelated to the PR.

When linked, rate relevance:
- high: direct effect
- medium: same feature/module but indirect
- low: possibly related but uncertain

Output JSON:
{"links":[{"id":"{ur_id}","relevance":"high|medium|low"}]} or {"links":[]}
