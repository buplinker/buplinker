PFA screenshot below: issue_#736: Allowing users to send logs to us Currently, if anyone is having a non-crash issue (like not getting any Nearby results), the best way we can help them is for them to send us logs. Unfortunately, the process of sending non-crash logs is quite convoluted and inconvenient for the user - they have to either install a 3rd party app, or get Android Studio running on their computer, etc. I wonder if there would be a way to have a function in the app that lets a user send us the last few pages of logs tagged with our app name.

I usually take about 5 pictures of the thing, and when I am back home I judge which one is the best. Problem: The first few pictures usually do not have GPS information. And quite often the first picture is the best. Actually, when uploading from Android I usually have the gallery app showing each picture fullscreen, and I swipe in chronological order, so the one which I upload to Commons is usually the first I took, often without GPS info.

Use case: The current process of contributing images for nearby places that need pictures is rather cumbersome. The user would have to go to the list or map of nearby places, and after finding a location that they want to photograph based on that, they would need to go back to the main screen of the app and submit their image via the standard upload process.

Also, in MultipleShareActivity, the following changes were made Behaviour changes : When user tries to share(upload) images to commons via MultipleShareActivity, following decision tree is followed a. If the app has permission for external storage, normal upload operation is followed b. If the app does not has the permission for external storage, dexter is used to ask for the same c. If the user gives us the required permission, normal upload flow is proceeded d. If the doesnot gives us the required permission a rationale dialog is shown with the appropriate message to let him know why we need the permission e. If he presses okay, steps a-c are followed and if he presses cancel, we close the app. f. If while asking for permission, the user chooses never ask again, then next time he tries to upload an image via MSA, the rational dialog follows the app setting screen where he could manually give us the required permission and the onActivityResult of same is handled Tested on {27 & name of samsung s7 }, with {build variant, ProdDebug}. issue_#1697: App doesnot ask for permission when multiple pics are shared [Summary:] App doesnot ask for storage permission when multiple pics are shared through gallery. [Steps to reproduce:] 1.Select pics you want to share through any gallery. 2.Click on the share button. 3.Select the commons app from the recommended app list. 4.The dialogue box which should appear asking for storage permission doesnot appear. issue_#1773: Use a library for checking various permissions [Summary:] Our app asks for runtime permissions in various places and in the past we have run into several issues/crashes because of missing permissions checks. The process of ensuring that permission is granted is cumbersome: Making sure that all these steps are followed correctly is a tedious task. It might be fruitful if we start using a 3rd party library for checking and handling permissions. I have tried out these two libraries in the past and found both of them to be quite useful. The first library uses simple annotations and the second library provides callback. All the hassle of checking and requesting permissions is taken care by the library itself.",https://github.com/commons-app/apps-android-commons/pull/1855,ashishkumar468,0,medium

Shame.","Fix permissions on API levels 23 and above The most significant and relevant changes are in ShareActivity.java Also I've found (I'm not sure how) but the app is happy to upload the image without any permissions so it has to be reading it from somewhere. Because of this the current implementation is to provide an option to the user via a snackbar to additionally give storage+location permissions, which allows the app to extract extra metadata when uploading. What's strange is that it must be possible without these permissions as a test upload I did included all the EXIF data when I gave the app no permissions, so we could change to extract it out of that. However we should consider if we want to force the user to give storage rights as otherwise often (it seems a bit random) the date is not added. Alternatively we could supply a date field? Also I have tested this on my phone (running 6.0.1), and a range of emulators however I don't have a physical device with API<=20 to test it on atm, so it would be good if someone could check before this is merged :) Also fixed a very small bug when testing, so incorrect password error is correctly recognised (WrongPluginPass).

They uploaded massive numbers of selfies and copyvios that had to be researched and deleted. Any images that weren't outright deleted were generally useless. The rate of useful images was so low that it wasn't worth the cost of dredging thought the bad images to find anything worthwhile.
