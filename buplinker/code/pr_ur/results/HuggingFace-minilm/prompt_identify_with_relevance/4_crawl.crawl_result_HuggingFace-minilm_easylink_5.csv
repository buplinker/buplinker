(And could use some eyes because of this.) To get hidpi to work in a browser canvas object, the internal dimensions need to be twice that of the external dimensions (essentially). The normal way of implementing this is to multiply the internal dimensions by devicePixelRatio, and scale the canvas accordingly. We used to do this, but 3925e26 changed things so that the external dimensions were halved. This was, according to the commit message, in order to prevent scaling artifacts on firefox. (Where the salient fact is that window.devicePixelRatio on some browsers, these days including chrome/firefox but not safari, also changes with browser zoom.) However, a consequence is that tile rendering is halved on hidpi devices, exactly not what should happen. This change also made for a lot of messy code that had to interact directly with devicePixelRatio. The half-size tile rendering wasn't immediately noticeable because the dungeon is auto-scaled, and the monster list matches its scale to the dungeon. But, icons in menus and popups instantiate the problem, and scaling them to the dungeon size is not ideal. The action panel also had some workarounds for this that I didn't fully understand at the time. (I only noticed this myself after many years of working on this stuff because I switched from a regular-density monitor to a 4k monitor of similar size, even though I've used retina devices for a long time. Hidpi devices have been broken for so long that I won't be surprised if we get requests to readd this behavior as an option or something, menus may look odd now to people who have only ever played on hidpi.) In my testing so far, I can't really detect any rendering differences between the approach after this commit and the approach in 3925e26.

I select ""Maximize vertical"". This makes the window about 80x90, but the game crashes with the message: ASSERT(valid_cursor_pos(pos.x, pos.y, region)) in 'libconsole.h' at line 58 failed. (invalid cursor position 40,-56 in region 1) If I start the game with an 80x90 window, it opens correctly, but making the window smaller, and then larger again, also makes it crash. If I make the window narrower or wider, even if I make it higher at the same time, it doesn't crash. issue_#3045: Crash: Octopode Chaos Knight, ""invalid cursor position"" [DESCRIPTION:] I had just equipped a second short blade weapon, at least that's the last thing I remember doing.
