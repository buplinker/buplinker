Hey :) Really love this app, the detailed changelogs and the constant improvements. One thing though: It recently started to give haptic feedback when using swipe-gestures to upvote or hide, etc. My Phone: Pixel 3a, Android 12 I disabled those vibrations system-wide. I only have vibrations enabled for incoming calls or notifications. It would be great if voyager would respect the system-wide settings or gave the option to disable.

The interface looks quite a bit like iOS. However, there aren't so many features in this app. One good thing is that there are no ads at all, and the overall experience is good. There isn't as much customizability as some other apps for Lemmy.","Add Apple Watch app I know what you're thinking. ""Alex, why are you spending precious time building an Apple Watch App?!"" Well, I got this from App Review. I'm not entirely sure if this high standard is applied to all apps submitted to the app store, or just to apps built using web technology, because most apps in the app store don't need to be native apps. But, I'm in no position to argue. And this Apple Watch app is pretty cool, actually. Please excuse the hacky code :-) It's an MVP and I'm quite rusty at Swift. Guideline 4.2 - Design - Minimum Functionality Your app provides a limited user experience as it is not sufficiently different from a mobile browsing experience. As such, the experience it provides is similar to the general experience of using Safari. Including iOS features such as push notifications, Core Location, and sharing do not provide a robust enough experience to be appropriate for the App Store. Next Steps To resolve this issue, please revise your app to provide a more robust user experience by including additional native iOS functionality. If you cannot - or choose not to - revise your app to be in compliance with the App Store Review Guidelines, you may wish to build an HTML5 web app instead. You can distribute web apps directly on your web site; the App Store does not accept or distribute web apps. For more information about creating web apps, refer to the Configuring Web Applications section of the Safari Web Content Guide. For a description of the HTML elements and attributes you can use in Safari on iPhone, check out Safari HTML Reference: Introduction. Please see attached screenshots for details.",https://github.com/aeharding/voyager/pull/578,aeharding,0,medium

Use cases: As of 1.4.0, I believe the best workflow is to use the (pretty great) search feature and use terms that appear in tht desired post. I am primarily using the iOS app now, so some of these are iOS-centric, but I'm sure some are valid for PWA and Android. This is an attempt at an somewhat exhaustive list of potential implementations (inspired by this Reddit post that helped refresh my memory). I imagine that some of these are trickier than others because Lemmy URLs aren't all from a single domain. I am no developer, so the compatibility column is my best guess.

Please describe.] I frequently start using Voyager from the Communities screen. Periodically reviewing the subscribed communities, sometimes I want to unsubscribe from one, or otherwise want to remove it from the list because of a lack of activity on it. Unsubscribing currently requires tapping on a community, then the ""..."" pea button, and finally Unsubscribe. [Describe the solution you'd like] Suggest a ""swipe left"" gesture on a community to offer an unsubscribe option. I believe this could be an Apollo Parity feature. My memory is getting fuzzy. [Describe alternatives you've considered] A Long Press option could be a suitable alternative. [Additional context] Currently using Voyager 2.9.1 on iOS 17.4.1.
