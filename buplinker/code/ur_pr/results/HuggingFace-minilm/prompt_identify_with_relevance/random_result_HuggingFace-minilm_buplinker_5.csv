It was being enabled and disabled at weird times since the settings don't take effect until one exits the page. This mostly rectifies that, though it won't be instant like the old UI, due to how the two UIs differ when events are sent. Also changed the behaviour of WM_USER_LOG_STATUS_CHANGED slightly to make it open a debug console when checked/true, in addition to simply re-enabling the menu bar option. If the user enables it, they probably want to see the output, so it makes sense to do it this way. One last thing, the option to En/Disable debug logging's been moved to Developer Tools to be consistent with the Old UI. This is an option intended for developers/power users, after all..
