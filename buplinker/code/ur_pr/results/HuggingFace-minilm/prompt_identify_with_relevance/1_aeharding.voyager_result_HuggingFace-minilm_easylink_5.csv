I'm sure contributors are already thinking about this, but I didn't see this captured in an existing open/closed issue. Use cases: As of 1.4.0, I believe the best workflow is to use the (pretty great) search feature and use terms that appear in tht desired post. I am primarily using the iOS app now, so some of these are iOS-centric, but I'm sure some are valid for PWA and Android. This is an attempt at an somewhat exhaustive list of potential implementations (inspired by this Reddit post that helped refresh my memory). I imagine that some of these are trickier than others because Lemmy URLs aren't all from a single domain. I am no developer, so the compatibility column is my best guess. All of these describe what to do with a Lemmy post URL: I am happy to split this up into component issues if that's preferred over this monolithic one 🙂. Keep up the great work.
