This is mostly an internal overhaul that hopefully makes Menu code easier to deal with overall, though there are a variety of user-facing small changes / bugfixes in the branch.

To get hidpi to work in a browser canvas object, the internal dimensions need to be twice that of the external dimensions (essentially). The normal way of implementing this is to multiply the internal dimensions by devicePixelRatio, and scale the canvas accordingly. We used to do this, but 3925e26 changed things so that the external dimensions were halved. This was, according to the commit message, in order to prevent scaling artifacts on firefox. (Where the salient fact is that window.devicePixelRatio on some browsers, these days including chrome/firefox but not safari, also changes with browser zoom.) However, a consequence is that tile rendering is halved on hidpi devices, exactly not what should happen. This change also made for a lot of messy code that had to interact directly with devicePixelRatio. The half-size tile rendering wasn't immediately noticeable because the dungeon is auto-scaled, and the monster list matches its scale to the dungeon. But, icons in menus and popups instantiate the problem, and scaling them to the dungeon size is not ideal. The action panel also had some workarounds for this that I didn't fully understand at the time. (I only noticed this myself after many years of working on this stuff because I switched from a regular-density monitor to a 4k monitor of similar size, even though I've used retina devices for a long time. Hidpi devices have been broken for so long that I won't be surprised if we get requests to readd this behavior as an option or something, menus may look odd now to people who have only ever played on hidpi.) In my testing so far, I can't really detect any rendering differences between the approach after this commit and the approach in 3925e26. However, I'm not exactly sure of what the original issues were, and this commit should be tested on a non-hidpi device before merge.",https://github.com/crawl/crawl/pull/2633,rawlins,0,high

Also pressing a point on the map brings up a small obstructive box of options. I cannot find the setting to disable this. Other than that, this is absolutely sublime!","fix: click + key modifier detection in tiles Fixes #898 The issue was caused because SDL_GetModState returns an OR'd combination of the modifier keys, but SDLWrapper::get_mod_state was comparing against the exact values of the flags. issue_#898: Shift+Left Click sometimes equips weapon instead of dropping it When reporting a bug, please include the following: [DESCRIPTION:] When you have a weapon in the inventory that you want to drop, Shift+Left Clicking it sometimes equips it instead of dropping it. I can't find any specific way to reproduce this behavior, except that when the issue starts to occur, it continues to occur until you save the game and load it again. If I do find a specific way to reproduce it, I'll comment to let you know.",https://github.com/crawl/crawl/pull/2360,dessaya,0,medium

Multiple play styles offer tons of replayability. Consistent content updates are both a blessing and a curse but definitely keep it fresh.

It's adjust size till 0.9. but it is too small for me.,"Android: Add a full screen option to the launcher I got this message from an Android user: can't enable full screen mode by setting ""tile_full_screen = true"", still shows a black bar on top with device status. I agree a full screen option for Android can improve the user experience. Mostly when playing on landscape mode with modern devices. You can read this in the docs: Where you set the UI flags makes a difference. If you hide the system bars in your activity's onCreate() method and the user presses Home, the system bars will reappear. When the user reopens the activity, onCreate() won't get called, so the system bars will remain visible. If you want system UI changes to persist as the user navigates in and out of your activity, set UI flags in onResume() or onWindowFocusChanged(). Tried both options and the behaviour when using onWindowsFocusChanged is more consistent. When using onResume, full screen is lost whenever you open the top menu.",https://github.com/crawl/crawl/pull/3988,robertxgray,0,high
