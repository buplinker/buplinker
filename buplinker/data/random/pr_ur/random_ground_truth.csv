Since I had a bunch with hundreds and thousands, I'm hoping those are the ones that are better to cache, anyway? But maybe I should use dec.GetDecVtxFmt().stride instead, or a combination thereof...

Because savestates need to be run outside a syscall, and the above makes threadsafe events run inside them (so there's no change in behavior), this just handles savestates more specially.

If they just get a bool to know when to stop the thread (that does nothing), they have to wake up every few milliseconds to poll the flag. Each wake-up costs a context switch that is not needed. Passing a stop CEvent instead is more flexible: CVideoSync implementers can still poll the flag if needed, but it is also possible to let the whole thread sleep until the stop is requested without intermittent wake-ups.I've avoided modifying the windowing implementations for which I was not sure how to correctly preserve the previous behavior and could not test myself.
